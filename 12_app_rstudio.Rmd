# R and RStudio Help {#app-rstudio}

Some students may not feel comfortable working in a console-based application
like RStudio. This appendix provides a basic bootcamp for Rstudio, but
cannot be a comprehensive manual on RStudio, and it certainly cannot be one for R.
Good places to get more detailed help include:

  - R help manuals
  - Stack Overflow
  
Some of the sections in this appendix are text-based, and some contain little
more than links to YouTube videos created by me or someone else.

## Projects and Directories


## R Packages


## Working with Tables


## Graphics with `ggplot`

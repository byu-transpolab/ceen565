# Urban Transportation Planning

Notes and assignments for CE 565 - Urban Transportation Planning (now with Quarto and renv!)

This repository contains course notes and assignments for a senior / graduate class in
transportation planning and elementary travel modeling. A description for this course
is:

> An advanced course in urban transportation planning. Urban transportation as the outcome of an economic system, details and techniques for four-step travel model development, applications of travel models within a legal and regulatory context.
The book is organized into six units:

  1. [Building Blocks](#chap-blocks)
  2. [Trip Generation](#chap-tripgen)
  3. [Trip Distribution](#chap-distribution)
  4. [Mode and Destination Choice](#chap-modechoice)
  5. [Network Assignment and Validation](#chap-assignment)
  6. [The Planning Process](#chap-process)
  
It may seem strange to put the chapter covering the planning process at the end
of the course, after students have learned the details of quantitative travel
modeling. The purpose for this is that I assign a term project where the
students build and calibrate a four-step model as they learn the techniques to do
so, and then complete an alternatives analysis using their models. To create
the time and space to do this project, we cover "softer" and conceptual topics
in the second half of the course.

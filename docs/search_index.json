["index.html", "Urban Transportation Planning Foreword", " Urban Transportation Planning Gregory Macfarlane, PhD, PE 2020-05-08 Foreword This book contains course notes and assignments for a senior / graduate class in transportation planning and elementary travel modeling. A description for this course is: An advanced course in urban transportation planning. Urban transportation as the outcome of an economic system, details and techniques for four-step travel model development, applications of travel models within a legal and regulatory context. The book is organized into six units: Building Blocks Trip Generation Trip Distribution Mode and Destination Choice Network Assignment and Validation The Planning Process It may seem strange to put the chapter covering the planning process at the end of the course, after students have learned the details of quantitative travel modeling. The purpose for this is that I assign a term project where the students build and calibrate a four-step model as they learn the techniques to do so, and then complete an alternatives analysis using their models. To create the time and space to do this project, we cover “softer” and conceptual topics in the second half of the course. The demonstration model the students calibrate and study is a model built in the Cube travel modeling software for the Roanoke, Virginia, metropolitan region. The model is a relatively advanced four-step, trip-based model with only 250 zones. The limited zone size means that the entire model system runs in approximately 15 minutes on a laptop computer. I am grateful to Virginia DOT for allowing my students the use of this model. Directions on how to use the Roanoke model are given in the Appendices. A handful of assignments require the students to write numerical programs or estimate statistical models. Some guidance on using R and RStudio to accomplish these assignments is also given in the Appendices.

Critical terms to understand are given in bold. 1.1 Planning for Human Systems If you look out on any sufficiently busy road, you will see a steady stream of vehicles passing by. Each vehicle is largely indistinguishable from the others, and it is easy as an engineer responsible for that road to see the cars driving by as little more than an input to a problem. But the people inside the cars should not be indistinguishable from each other. Each person who is driving or riding in each of those cars has their own reasons to be driving on that road. One person might be driving to work; one person might be trying to get home to his or her family. Another car might hold a family going on vacation, or a group of friends heading to a movie. If you don’t recognize that each person who travels is different, with different needs and purposes, then it is easy to look only at the supply of transportation infrastructure. Is the road wide enough? Is the traffic signal timed appropriately? But as with anything in the economy transportation is a function of both supply and demand. Why are so many people trying to get down this one road right now? Why didn’t more people take transit? Why didn’t some people choose a different destination? Or why didn’t some people just stay home in the first place? Transportation planning therefore must be concerned with both the supply of infrastructure and the demand for travel. For the most part, economists consider travel a derived demand, which means people only go to the hassle of travelling somewhere if they have some other reason to be there. No one typically just drives around (with the possible exception of teenagers on a weekend night); they are going to work, or school, or a social engagement, or something. Travel demand has not been stable over time. The availability of inexpensive automobiles in the 20th Century created demand for inter-city and intra-urban roads that did not exist before. Rising labor force participation rates for women radically changed the number and types of trips the average household makes in an average day. Technological developments like teleconferencing and smartphone-enabled ridehailing could generate different trends. At the same time, populations in most regions continue to grow. Planning for future transportation infrastructure is difficult because of the uncertainty of the future, but it is necessary to keep economies rolling and preseve or improve quality of life. In the United States and most societies with some democratic process, decisions about what transportation facilities to build, which policies to implement, and how to build a city generally fall to decision makers. These decision makers consist of mayors, city councils, planning commissions, state legislatures, Congress, state and federal agencies, and innumerable others who are elected by the public, or who are accountable to others who have been. In making decisions about how to spend public money on civil infrastructure or enact tax or other policies, decision makers consult plans developed by professional engineers and planners. As engineers and planners, we are rarely in a position to make decisions, but we have a responsibility to provide accurate data and technical analysis to support decision makers. There is a misconception that transportation planners must accurately predict the future to be relevant. The purpose of transportation planning is not to perfectly envision what will happen under every scenario, it is to provide information that will help make good decisions now so that the future is at least as pleasant as the present. We all have hopes for what our lives and community will look like ten or twenty years from now; it may not be possible for anyone to provide analysis entirely free of all personal bias. But as you conduct your work as an engineer and planner, you owe the public your integrity and competence as you provide information to their representatives. 1.2 Travel Model Building Blocks In this section, we present some of the terms used in transportation planning and modeling, as well as some of the data objects used in constructing travel demand models. 1.2.1 Household Travel Surveys Travel demand models try to represent individual behavior. How many trips does the average household make per day? How do people respond to changes in transit fare? And how can a modeler know if the model accurately reflects total traffic? Household travel surveys are a critical component of much travel modeling practice and research, and are a primary way to answer some of these questions. In a travel survey, a regional planning agency1 will recruit households to participate in the survey. Often there is some kind of reward to encourage participation, like a gift card or raffle. Once recruited, household members fill out a diary of their activities on an assigned day; Figure 1.1 shows an example of one activity from a survey diary. From the example, you can see the kinds of data that are available: where the person traveled, which travel mode they used, and what was their reason for making the trip. Figure 1.1: Example travel survey diary entry. Not all travel surveys are filled in on forms; nowadays telephone interviews or mobile applications are more common (more on that below). But for decades, paper travel surveys were the basis of almost all transportation behavior science. Once the surveys are collected, the data is usually processed into several tables stored in different files or a database. A Households table has one row for each household in the dataset, including information about the number of people in the household, the number of vehicles, and the household income. A Persons table has one row for each person in the dataset — including which household they are a part of (to link with the households table) — and personal attributes like age, student or worker status. A Vehicles table has one row for each vehicle owned by the households in in the dataset, including attributes like model year, vehicle class, and fuel efficiency. A Trips table has one row for each trip taken by each person in the dataset. This table can be linked against the other tables if necessary, and contains information like the trip purpose and many other elements collected with the form in Figure 1.1. Tables 1.1 through 1.4 show data collected from one household in the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. The household contains four people, two of whom are working adults in their late thirties. (the other two are children, and the NHTS did not collect their trip data). The household has two vehicles, and on the survey travel day person 2 appeared to make a few very long trips. It’s impossible to know if this is a typical day for this person or not, but that’s the data that was collected.

This is a survey weight. Because it is impossible to sample everyone in a population, there needs to be a way to expand the survey to the population. What this number means is that the selected household carries the same weight in this survey as approximately 1100 households in the general population. Also note that not every household’s weight will be equal; because some population groups have different survey response weights, some households will need to be weighted more heavily so that the survey reflects the general population. Most software packages have functions that allow you to calculate statistics or estimate models including weighted values. The code chunk below shows how to calculate the average number of workers per household with and without weights in R; as you can see, omitting the weights leads to a substantial change in the survey analysis. # Average workers per household with no weights mean(nhts_households$wrkcount) ## [1] 0.9891438 # Average workers per household, weighted weighted.mean(nhts_households$wrkcount, nhts_households$wthhfin) ## [1] 1.173206 Travel survey methodology is changing rapidly as a result of mobile devices with location capabilities. First, most travel surveys are now administered through a mobile application: respondents are invited to install an app on their smartphone that tracks the respondent’s position and occasionally asks questions about trip purpose or mode. This makes collecting and cleaning data considerably easier than traditional paper surveys, and it also lowers the response burden for the survey participants. Another change that mobile data has brought to travel surveys is the introduction of large datasets of location information that planners can purchase directly from cellular providers or third-party providers. Though these data do not have all the information on demographics and preferences a survey would provide, they provide a considerably larger and more detailed sample on things like overall trip flows. As a result, it may be possible to collect surveys less frequently, or to reduce survey sample sizes. 1.2.2 Travel Analysis Zones SE Data Households Firms 1.2.3 Highway Networks Functional Type Link capacity Free-flow speed Centroid connectors 1.2.4 Matrices Skim matrices OD matrices 1.3 Statistical and Mathematical Techniques Many elements of travel modeling and forecasting require complex numerical and quantitative techniques. In this section we will present some of these techniques. 1.3.1 Continuous and Discrete Distributions 1.3.2 Iterative Proportional Fitting Iterative Proportional Fitting 1.3.3 Regression Analysis 1.3.4 Numerical Optimization Let’s say you have a function with a Homework Some of these questions require a completed run of the demonstration model. For instructions on accessing and running the model, see the Appendix How does recreational transportation — i.e., going for a bike ride — fit into the theory of derived demand for travel? Write a short paragraph explaining your thoughts based on what we covered in lecture and the text. Think about a recent transportation-related construction project you have seen in your community. Find an article in a local newspaper discussing the project. Why was the project built (or why is it being built)? Who supports the project? Does anyone oppose the project? Write a short paragraph including a link and citation to the article. Download the rmove mobile application, and log in with the password given you by the instructor. Track your daily activies and trips for three days. You may include at most one weekend day. Write a short summary of your activities, including: How many trips you took each day The mode split of all your trips With the TAZ layer and socioeconomic data in the demonstration model, make a set of choropleth maps showing: total households; household density; total jobs; job density; density of manufacturing vs office vs retail employment. Compare your maps with aerial imagery from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Describe the spatial patterns of the socioeconomic data in the model region. Identify which zones constitute the central business district, and identify any outlying employment centers. With the highway network layer in the demonstration model, create maps showing: link functional type; link free flow speed; and link hourly capacity. Compare your maps with aerial imagery from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Identify the major freeways and principal arterials in the model region. Note: you will need to run the demonstration model through the network setup step to calculate the capacities and append them to the link. Find the shortest free-flow speed path along the network between two zones. Find the shortest distance path between the same two zones. Are the paths the same? Do the paths match what an online mapping service shows for a trip in the middle of the night? Open the highway assignment report, which shows vehicle hours and miles traveled by facility type. What percent of the region’s VMT occurs on freeways? What percent of the region’s lane-miles are freeways? Open the output highway network. Create a map of the highway links showing PM period level of service based on the volume to capacity ratios in the table below. How would you characterize traffic in Roanoke? Which is the worst-performing major facility? Like a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO).↩ "],

["app-rstudio.html", "B R and RStudio Help B.1 Installing B.2 RStudio Orientation B.3 R Packages B.4 Working with Tables B.5 Graphics with ggplot", " B R and RStudio Help R is a powerful, open-source statistical programming language used by both professional and academic data scientists. It is among the computer languages most suited to modern data science, and is growing rapidly in its user base and available packages. Some students may not feel comfortable working in a programming language like R or a console-based application like RStudio, especially if they have used applications primarily through a GUI. This appendix provides a basic bootcamp for R and Rstudio, but cannot be a comprehensive manual on RStudio, and it certainly cannot be one for R. Good places to get more detailed help include: R help manuals Stack Overflow Some of the sections in this appendix are text-based, and some contain little more than links to YouTube videos created by me or someone else. B.1 Installing There are two pieces of software you should install: R https://cran.r-project.org/: this contains the system libraries necessary to run R commands in a terminal on your computer, and contains a few additional helper applications. Install the most recent stable release for your operating system. RStudio https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ is an integrated application that makes using R considerably easier with text completion, file managment, and some GUI features. Both software are available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The videos and screenshots of the application I post will use MacOS; the R code for all systems is the same, and the RStudio interface all systems is very similar with minor differences. B.2 RStudio Orientation The video below gives a very basic introduction to RStudio. There is also a very useful cheat sheet for working with RStudio on the Rstudio website. B.3 R Packages One of the strengths of R is the ability for anyone to write packages. These packages make it easier to read manipulate, and vizualize data; to estimate statistical models; or to communicate results. There are a number of ways to install additional packages. The most straightforward is to use the install.packages() function in the console. The problems in this book are solved with two additional packages2: RStudio also contains an interface to install and update packages. Sometimes you want to use a package that has not yet been pushed to CRAN, the international repository of “approved” R packages. This may be because the package is in development, or for one reason or another does not meet CRAN’s standards for completeness, etc. Oftentimes, the package has been made available on GitHub. You can install a package directly from GitHub with the devtools library. One package you will want for the problems in the book is the nhts2017 package on the BYU Transportation GitHub account. install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) # tools for installing development packages devtools::install_github(&quot;gregmacfarlane/nhts2017&quot;) You only need to install a package once on your computer. But every time you want to use a function in a package, you need to load the package with the library() function. To load the tidyverse packages, for instance, library(tidyverse) If you get errors when you run the command above, it means that for some reason you did not install the package correctly. And if you ever get an error like kable(tibble(x = 1:2, y = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;))) x y 1 blue 2 red It often means you didn’t load the library. In this case, the kable() function to make pretty tables is part of the knitr package. library(knitr) kable(tibble(x = 1:2, y = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;))) x y 1 blue 2 red B.4 Working with Tables Most data you will work with comes in a tabular form, meaning that the data is formatted in columns of variables and rows of observations. B.4.1 Reading Data Tabular data is often stored in a comma-separated values .csv file. To read a data file like this in R, you can use the read_csv() function included in tidyverse. trips &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/demo_trips.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## houseid = col_double(), ## personid = col_character(), ## trpmiles = col_double(), ## trippurp = col_character() ## ) print(trips) ## # A tibble: 924 x 4 ## houseid personid trpmiles trippurp ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 30182694 01 13.6 HBW ## 2 40532989 02 9.38 HBSOCREC ## 3 40729475 01 5.06 HBSHOP ## 4 40290784 01 0.509 HBSOCREC ## 5 30118876 02 0.599 NHB ## 6 30352119 01 20.3 HBO ## 7 30085077 01 22.5 NHB ## 8 30180962 02 0.581 HBSOCREC ## 9 40155356 01 2.74 HBO ## 10 30069734 01 4.65 NHB ## # … with 914 more rows This function will make a guess as to what the columns types should be. Often we want to keep ID values as characters, even if they are numeric (this preserves leading 0 values, etc.). We can tell read_csv() what types we expect with the col_types argument. trips &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/demo_trips.csv&quot;, col_types = list(houseid = col_character())) print(trips) ## # A tibble: 924 x 4 ## houseid personid trpmiles trippurp ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 30182694 01 13.6 HBW ## 2 40532989 02 9.38 HBSOCREC ## 3 40729475 01 5.06 HBSHOP ## 4 40290784 01 0.509 HBSOCREC ## 5 30118876 02 0.599 NHB ## 6 30352119 01 20.3 HBO ## 7 30085077 01 22.5 NHB ## 8 30180962 02 0.581 HBSOCREC ## 9 40155356 01 2.74 HBO ## 10 30069734 01 4.65 NHB ## # … with 914 more rows You can also write tables back to .csv with the write_csv() command. B.4.2 Modifying and Summarizing Tables In much of this section, we will work with the nhts_trips dataset of trips from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey in the nhts2017 package you installed from GitHub above. library(nhts2017) trips &lt;- nhts_trips trips ## # A tibble: 923,572 x 62 ## houseid personid tdtrpnum strttime endtime ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; ## 1 300000… 01 1 2017-10-10 10:00:00 2017-10-10 10:15:00 ## 2 300000… 01 2 2017-10-10 15:10:00 2017-10-10 15:30:00 ## 3 300000… 02 1 2017-10-10 07:00:00 2017-10-10 09:00:00 ## 4 300000… 02 2 2017-10-10 18:00:00 2017-10-10 20:30:00 ## 5 300000… 03 1 2017-10-10 08:45:00 2017-10-10 09:00:00 ## 6 300000… 03 2 2017-10-10 14:30:00 2017-10-10 14:45:00 ## 7 300000… 01 1 2017-10-10 11:15:00 2017-10-10 11:30:00 ## 8 300000… 01 2 2017-10-10 23:30:00 2017-10-10 23:40:00 ## 9 300000… 01 1 2017-10-10 05:50:00 2017-10-10 06:05:00 ## 10 300000… 01 2 2017-10-10 07:00:00 2017-10-10 07:15:00 ## # … with 923,562 more rows, and 57 more variables: trvlcmin &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # trpmiles &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, trptrans &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, trpaccmp &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # trphhacc &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, vehid &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, trwaittm &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # numtrans &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, tracctm &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, drop_prk &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tregrtm &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, whodrove &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, whyfrom &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # loop_trip &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, trphhveh &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, hhmemdrv &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # hh_ontd &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, nonhhcnt &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, numontrp &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # psgr_flg &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, pubtrans &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, trippurp &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # dweltime &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, tdwknd &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, vmt_mile &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # drvr_flg &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, whytrp1s &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p1 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # ontd_p2 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p3 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p4 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # ontd_p5 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p6 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p7 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # ontd_p8 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p9 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p10 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # ontd_p11 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p12 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p13 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tdcaseid &lt;chr&gt;, tracc_wlk &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tracc_pov &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tracc_bus &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tracc_crl &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tracc_sub &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tracc_oth &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tregr_wlk &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tregr_pov &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tregr_bus &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tregr_crl &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tregr_sub &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tregr_oth &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, whyto &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, gasprice &lt;chr&gt;, wttrdfin &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # whytrp90 &lt;chr+lbl&gt; B.4.2.1 Select, Filter, and Chains This table is pretty overwhelming. But there are two functions that can help us pare it down: select() lets you select columns in a table using the names of the columns. filter() lets you select rows in a table that meet a certain condition. Let’s practice this by selecting our trips dataset to only include the id columns, the trip length, and the trip purpose. select(trips, houseid, personid, trpmiles, trippurp) ## # A tibble: 923,572 x 4 ## houseid personid trpmiles trippurp ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt; &lt;chr+lbl&gt; ## 1 30000007 01 5.24 HBO [Home-based trip (other)] ## 2 30000007 01 5.15 HBO [Home-based trip (other)] ## 3 30000007 02 84.0 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 4 30000007 02 81.6 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 5 30000007 03 2.25 HBO [Home-based trip (other)] ## 6 30000007 03 2.24 HBO [Home-based trip (other)] ## 7 30000008 01 8.02 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 8 30000008 01 8.02 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 9 30000012 01 3.40 HBSOCREC [Home-based trip (social/recreatio… ## 10 30000012 01 3.40 HBSOCREC [Home-based trip (social/recreatio… ## # … with 923,562 more rows Let’s also practice filtering the trips dataset to only include trips of the purpose “HBO” (home-based other). Notice how the number of rows in the table trips is much smaller. filter(trips, trippurp == &quot;HBW&quot;) # use double equals as comparison ## # A tibble: 117,368 x 62 ## houseid personid tdtrpnum strttime endtime ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; ## 1 300000… 02 1 2017-10-10 07:00:00 2017-10-10 09:00:00 ## 2 300000… 02 2 2017-10-10 18:00:00 2017-10-10 20:30:00 ## 3 300000… 01 1 2017-10-10 11:15:00 2017-10-10 11:30:00 ## 4 300000… 01 2 2017-10-10 23:30:00 2017-10-10 23:40:00 ## 5 300000… 01 5 2017-10-10 09:00:00 2017-10-10 09:20:00 ## 6 300000… 01 7 2017-10-10 15:30:00 2017-10-10 16:05:00 ## 7 300000… 01 1 2017-10-10 08:00:00 2017-10-10 08:20:00 ## 8 300000… 01 2 2017-10-10 18:00:00 2017-10-10 20:00:00 ## 9 300000… 02 3 2017-10-10 09:00:00 2017-10-10 11:00:00 ## 10 300000… 02 4 2017-10-10 18:30:00 2017-10-10 20:30:00 ## # … with 117,358 more rows, and 57 more variables: trvlcmin &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # trpmiles &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, trptrans &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, trpaccmp &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # trphhacc &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, vehid &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, trwaittm &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # numtrans &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, tracctm &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, drop_prk &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tregrtm &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, whodrove &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, whyfrom &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # loop_trip &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, trphhveh &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, hhmemdrv &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # hh_ontd &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, nonhhcnt &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, numontrp &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # psgr_flg &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, pubtrans &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, trippurp &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # dweltime &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, tdwknd &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, vmt_mile &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, ## # drvr_flg &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, whytrp1s &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p1 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # ontd_p2 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p3 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p4 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # ontd_p5 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p6 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p7 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # ontd_p8 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p9 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p10 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # ontd_p11 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p12 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ontd_p13 &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tdcaseid &lt;chr&gt;, tracc_wlk &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tracc_pov &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tracc_bus &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tracc_crl &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tracc_sub &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tracc_oth &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tregr_wlk &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tregr_pov &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tregr_bus &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tregr_crl &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, tregr_sub &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, ## # tregr_oth &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, whyto &lt;chr+lbl&gt;, gasprice &lt;chr&gt;, wttrdfin &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # whytrp90 &lt;chr+lbl&gt; One extremely useful feature of the tidyverse functions is the chain operator, %&gt;%. This operator basically does the opposite of the assigment operator &lt;-. While assignment says “take the thing on the right and put it in the thing on the left,” chain says “take the thing on the left and pass it as the first argument of the function on the right.” What this means in practice is we can chain R commands together. So we can do the select and the filter statements in sequence, trips %&gt;% select(houseid, personid, trpmiles, trippurp) %&gt;% filter(trippurp == &quot;HBW&quot;) ## # A tibble: 117,368 x 4 ## houseid personid trpmiles trippurp ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt; &lt;chr+lbl&gt; ## 1 30000007 02 84.0 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 2 30000007 02 81.6 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 3 30000008 01 8.02 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 4 30000008 01 8.02 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 5 30000012 01 4.29 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 6 30000012 01 6.82 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 7 30000039 01 11.5 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 8 30000041 01 73.7 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 9 30000041 02 77.9 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## 10 30000041 02 77.8 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] ## # … with 117,358 more rows Notice that we didn’t have to tell the select and filter functions the name of the table we were selecting or filtering. The %&gt;% chain operator did that for us. Once we have the table we want, we can assign it to a new object called mytrips In this case, let’s get HBO and HBW trips. mytrips &lt;- trips %&gt;% select(houseid, personid, trpmiles, trippurp) %&gt;% filter(trippurp %in% c(&quot;HBW&quot;, &quot;HBO&quot;)) # use %in% for multiple comparisons. B.4.3 Mutate, Summarize, and Group Sometimes we want to calculate a new column in a table, or recompute an existing column. We can do that with the mutate function, and we can put more than one calculation in a single mutate statement. mytrips %&gt;% mutate( tripkm = trpmiles * 1.60934, # convert miles to km. longtrip = ifelse(tripkm &gt; 50, TRUE, FALSE) # is trip longer than 50 km? ) ## # A tibble: 307,390 x 6 ## houseid personid trpmiles trippurp tripkm longtrip ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt; &lt;chr+lbl&gt; &lt;dbl+lb&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 30000007 01 5.24 HBO [Home-based trip (oth… 8.44 FALSE ## 2 30000007 01 5.15 HBO [Home-based trip (oth… 8.29 FALSE ## 3 30000007 02 84.0 HBW [Home-based trip (wor… 135.

For this we can use the summarize() function. mytrips %&gt;% summarize( mean_trip = mean(trpmiles), sd_trip = sd(trpmiles), max_trip = max(trpmiles), min_trip = min(trpmiles) ) ## # A tibble: 1 x 4 ## mean_trip sd_trip max_trip min_trip ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 9.81 32.1 5699. -9 Finally, we sometimes want to calculate summary statistics for different groups. We can tell tidyverse to group our tables with the group_by() function. mytrips %&gt;% group_by(trippurp) %&gt;% summarize( mean_trip = mean(trpmiles), sd_trip = sd(trpmiles), max_trip = max(trpmiles), min_trip = min(trpmiles) ) ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## trippurp mean_trip sd_trip max_trip min_trip ## * &lt;chr+lbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 HBO [Home-based trip (other)] 7.73 32.0 5699. -9 ## 2 HBW [Home-based trip (work)] 13.2 31.9 2927. -9 As you might expect, work trips are on average longer than other kinds of trips. But some people report very long trips! You might want to filter your data more carefully for real analyses. B.5 Graphics with ggplot tidyverse is actually a collection of very useful packages, and many R users just load them all at once.↩ "]

The model is written for the CUBE travel modeling software package, the same software used by the Wasatch Front Regional Council model. The model code and files are available on Box. A few key parameters files have been reset to default values, rather than the calibrated values used in the actual model. The homework assignments and lab activities in this course will walk you through re-calibrating the model to use in your term assignments. A.1 Running the Model The model files are available from Box as a compressed file called rvtpo_bare.zip. Extract this file to a folder on your local computer. I prefer to keep my models in a folder on the C:\\ drive called C:\\projects. It may be that the C drive is not available to you, but you should place the model at a path that makes sense and that will not change from session to session. It is possible that the J: drive will not have enough space for multiple runs of the model. The path that you choose must have no spaces, from the drive letter to the final folder, i.e., C:\\folder\\folder\\rvtpo_bare. If there are any spaces your model will crash. Figure A.1: RVTPO model home folder Double-click on the roanoke.cat Cube catalog file. This will open the model application interface in Cube. On this interface you can see the steps the model will execute, as well as access the input / output files for each step. Some steps actually contain several sub-steps, and double-clicking the yellow step box will expand that application. Figure A.2: RVTPO model application interface Run the base scenario of the model by pushing the large blue “Run” button in the upper left-hand corner of the Cube application. A window will appear first asking you to confirm which scenario you are running, and then showing you the progress. This model takes approximately 15 minutes to run on my laptop.1 Complete instructions are included in the model user’s guide (in the usersguide/ folder). I have also made a YouTube video showing these steps. Note that the video shows you getting the model from Canvas; get it from Box. A.2 Files and Reports A.3 Network and Zone Maps You can use Cube to create maps of network and zone data that you can use for debugging and analysis. You can also include these graphics in reports and presentations. For example, Figure A.3 shows the network links by facility type. The video below shows how to do this. Figure A.3: Facility types in the Roanoke region. A.3.1 Shortest Paths You can use Cube to measure the shortest path between two points in your model network. You can also make isochrone maps of the travel time to various destinations from a specific origin point, like the map shown in Figure A.4. The video below shows how to do this. Figure A.4: Isochrone map using network speed information. A.3.2 Working with Matrices A.3.3 Writing Custom Scripts It’s a small model with only about 250 zones; a larger model like WFRC will take many hours. Generally model run time increases with the square of the zones.↩︎ "]

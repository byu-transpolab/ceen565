Assume a gravity model of the form. \\[T_{ij}=\\frac{P_iA_j^*(t_{ij})^{-b}}{\\sum_{j&#39;}A^*_{j&#39;}(t_{ij})^{-b}}\\] where \\(A_j^*\\) is a ``modified attraction term’’ defined by the algorithm shown in the figure below. This algorithm constrains the predicted trips to a given zone to equal the true zonal attractions \\(A_j\\). Question 1: Write a computer program or build a spreadsheet that computes the O-D flows for this system using the algorithm (with \\(\\varepsilon=1\\)). Find the value of \\(b\\) (to a single decimal place) which provides the “best fit” with the observed O-D matrix in the table below. Discuss how you determined which \\(b\\) value gave the “best fit.” \\(i\\) 1 2 3 1 80 5 15 2 80 40 80 3 40 5 55 Question 2: The region represented in Question 1 has begun improvements to the link between zones 1 and 2 that will reduce the travel time from 5 to 3. Using your program and the value of \\(b\\) estimated above, determine the effect of this improvement on the predicted trip distribution matrix. Is the response reasonable?

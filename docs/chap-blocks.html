<div id="planning-for-human-systems" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Planning for Human Systems</h2>
<p>If you look out on any sufficiently busy road, you will see a steady stream of
vehicles passing by. Each vehicle is largely indistinguishable from the others,
and it is easy as an engineer responsible for that road to see the cars driving
by as little more than an input to a problem. But the <em>people</em> inside the cars
should not be indistinguishable from each other. Each person who is driving or
riding in each of those cars has their own reasons to be driving on that road.
One person might be driving to work; one person might be trying to get home to
his or her family. Another car might hold a family going on vacation, or a group
of friends heading to a movie.</p>
<p>If you don’t recognize that each person who travels is different, with different
needs and purposes, then it is easy to look only at the <strong>supply</strong> of transportation
infrastructure. Is the road wide enough? Is the traffic signal timed appropriately?
But as with anything in the economy transportation is a function of both supply
and <strong>demand</strong>. Why are so many people trying to get down this one road <em>right now</em>?
Why didn’t more people take transit? Why didn’t some people choose a different
destination? Or why didn’t some people just stay home in the first place?</p>
<p>Transportation planning therefore must be concerned with both the supply of
infrastructure and the demand for travel. For the most part, economists consider
travel a <strong>derived demand</strong>, which means people only go to the hassle of
traveling somewhere if they have some other reason to be there. No one
typically just drives around (with the possible exception of teenagers on a
weekend night); they are going to work, or school, or a social engagement, or
<em>something</em>.</p>
<p>Travel demand has not been stable over time. The availability of inexpensive
automobiles in the 20th Century created demand for inter-city and intra-urban
roads that did not exist before. Rising labor force participation rates for
women radically changed the number and types of trips the average household
makes in an average day. Technological developments like teleconferencing and
smartphone-enabled ridehailing could generate different trends. At the same
time, populations in most regions continue to grow. <strong>Planning</strong> for future
transportation infrastructure is difficult because of the uncertainty of the
future, but it is necessary to keep economies rolling and preserve or improve
quality of life.</p>
<p>In the United States and most societies with some democratic process,
<strong>decisions</strong> about what transportation facilities to build, which policies to
implement, and how to build a city generally fall to <strong>decision makers</strong>. These
decision makers consist of mayors, city councils, planning commissions,
state legislatures, Congress, state and federal agencies, and innumerable others
who are elected by the public, or who are accountable to others who have been.
In making decisions about how to spend public money on civil infrastructure or
enact tax or other policies, decision makers consult <strong>plans</strong> developed by
professional engineers and planners.</p>
<p>As engineers and planners, we are rarely in a position to <em>make</em> decisions, but
we have a responsibility to provide accurate data and technical analysis to
support decision makers. There is a misconception that transportation planners
must accurately predict the future to be relevant. The purpose of transportation
planning is not to perfectly envision what will happen under every scenario,
it is to provide information that will help make good decisions now so that
the future is at least as pleasant as the present. We all have hopes for what
our lives and community will look like ten or twenty years from now; it may not
be possible for anyone to provide analysis entirely free of all personal bias.
But as you conduct your work as an engineer and planner, you owe the public your
integrity and competence as you provide information to their representatives.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-four-step-transportation-planning-process" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The Four-Step Transportation Planning Process</h2>
<p>How can you know what might happen in the future? And how might that change based
on decisions that you make today? This basic question is at the heart of
transportation planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>What might traffic look like if we build nothing and population still grows?</li>
<li>Can we build less if we change land development patterns?</li>
<li>How many people will use this new transit line?</li>
</ul>
<p>In many fields — including politics, meteorology, economics, etc. —
professionals who seek answers to questions like this do so with the help of a
<strong>model</strong>. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-world system.
In any model, there are things that need to vary (called inputs), things that
can be estimated or calibrated (called parameters), and results (called outputs).
There are also things that are held fixed. The specific mathematical structure
of the model, and which things get included and which things are excluded or
abstracted away, determine what the model should and should not be used for.</p>
<p>For example, we might try to predict something with a linear model,
<span class="math display" id="eq:basic-model">\[\begin{equation}
  y = \alpha + \beta x + \varepsilon
  \tag{1.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
In this case <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the output, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the input, the
<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> parameter defines how the input influences the outcomes, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a
fixed value, and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> accounts for the random influence of all the
factors we did not include. We could add more <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> terms to
include more factors in the model. We could also change the mathematical format
of the model to represent different types of outcomes, or chain several smaller
models together to represent more complex relationships. If we wanted to see what
might happen if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> changed, we could put in a new value into this equation
and the output result <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> might be a plausible prediction. The plausibility of
the output is a function of how well the mathematical model actually represents
the reality of the system.</p>
<p>In this class you will learn the details of the <em>travel demand modeling process</em>,
which is a chain of many models, each with different inputs and outputs. A
travel demand model on the whole has two basic inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Socioeconomic data representing where people live and work and go to school and
do other things.</li>
<li>Transportation network data representing the roads and transit services and
other methods people use to get between their activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic outputs of a travel demand model are transportation volumes and levels
of service. There are many ways to design and build travel demand models, but
the traditional way most regions in the United States approach travel demand models
is through a <strong>four step</strong>, trip-based<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> process. The four steps are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Trip Generation</li>
<li>Trip Distribution</li>
<li>Mode Choice</li>
<li>Route Assignment</li>
</ol>
<p>A <em>trip generation</em> model determines how many trips are produced in each <em>zone</em>
(neighborhood), and how many trips are attracted to each zone. The inputs to
this model is the socioeconomic data in each zone. Mathematically, trip generation
can be represented as
<span class="math display" id="eq:tripgen">\[\begin{equation}
  P_i = f(SE_i), A_j = f(SE_j)
  \tag{1.2}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are the production and destination zone indexes.</p>
<p>A <em>trip distribution</em> model seeks to pair the productions and attractions in the
zones based on the travel costs <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> between the two zones. Mathematically, trip
distribution can be represented as
<span class="math display" id="eq:tripdist">\[\begin{equation}
  T_{ij} = f(P_i, A_j, c_{ij})
  \tag{1.3}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>A <em>mode choice</em> model estimates how many of the trips from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> will happen

<p>A <em>route assignment</em> model determines the specific routes that the trips going

<p>On the whole, the travel demand model can be represented mathematically as a
single function where the output transportation volumes and levels of service
are a function of the input socioeconomic information and travel costs.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Travel Model Building Blocks</h2>
<p>In this section, we present some of the terms used in transportation planning
and modeling, as well as some of the data objects used in constructing travel
demand models.</p>
<div id="travel-analysis-zones-and-se-data" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Travel Analysis Zones and SE Data</h3>
<p>The “people” in a model conduct <em>activities</em>: work, school, recreation, and
other activities. Because travel is a derived demand, the purpose of travel is to
move between these activities. So a travel model needs a way to represent where
the households, persons, jobs, and activities are located in space.</p>
<p>Activities in travel demand models happen in <strong>Travel Analysis Zones</strong> (TAZs).
The model tries to represent trips between the TAZs. Because trips inside a
TAZ — called intrazonal trips — are not included in the travel model, each
TAZ should be sufficiently small such that these trips do not affect the models’
ability to forecast travel on roadways. The following rules are helpful when
drawing TAZ’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>The TAZ should not stretch across major roadways</li>
<li>The TAZ should contain principally one land use, though in some areas this
is not possible.</li>
<li>In areas with more dense population, the TAZ should be smaller.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each TAZ is associated with <strong>socioeconomic</strong> (SE) data, or information about
the people, businesses, and other activities that are located in the TAZ.
<strong>Households</strong> are a basic unit of analysis in many economic and statistical
analyses. A household typically consists of one or more <strong>persons</strong> who reside
in the same dwelling. Individuals living in the same dwelling can make up a
family or other group of individuals; that is, a group of roommates is
considered a household. Not everyone lives in households, however; some people
live in what are called group quarters: military barracks, college dormitories,
monasteries, prisons, etc. Travel models need to handle these people as well, but
in this class we will focus on people who live in households.</p>
<p>Households in travel models are often grouped into a classification scheme
based on the number of people in the household, the number of children, the number
of vehicles, etc. Households of different classifications will have different
behavior in the rest of the model.</p>
<div class="rmdthink">
<p>Your lab activity for this unit will walk you through specifying a
household classification model.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Firms</strong> are another basic unit of analysis in many economic and statistical
analyses. A firm is a profit-seeking person or entity that provides goods or
services in exchange for monetary transactions. A firm can provide raw resources,
manufactured resources, other services, or be a place of employment. In some
cases, a firm may be another household. Each firm will have an <em>industry</em> type.
Examples of industry types include office, service, manufacturing, retail, etc.
In many SE data files, firms are simply represented as the total number of
jobs in a TAZ belonging to each industry. Other <strong>Institutions</strong> including
academic, government, and non-profit entities will also be represented in the SE
data in terms of their jobs.</p>
<p>It is important to be precise in our definitions when put all of these different
items into an analysis. A typical socioeconomic data table for a small region is
given in Table <a href="chap-blocks.html#tab:setable">1.1</a>. Note the following relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persons live in Households</li>
<li>Workers are Persons who have a Job</li>
<li>Firms have employees who work at a Jobs</li>

<p>When we talk about “how many jobs” are in a TAZ, we mean “How many people do
the firms located in that TAZ employ,” and not “how many people who live
in that TAZ are workers.”</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Transportation Networks</h3>
<p>The purpose of a travel model is to understand how people are likely to use
transportation infrastructure, so there has to be a way to represent
roadway and transit systems. We do this with a
<em>network</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. A network consists of
two basic data structures: <strong>Nodes</strong> and <strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>Nodes are points in space. In a highway network, almost all nodes represent
intersections between different roads. Some important nodes represent the
<strong>TAZ Centroids</strong>, or the points where the households and jobs in the travel
model are located.</p>
<p>Links connect nodes, and represent roads. Links have many different attributes
describing the characteristics of the roadway they represent. The two most
important link attributes are the link’s <em>speed</em> and <em>capacity</em>, because they
provide the travel costs (<span class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span> above) to the various steps of the model. But
these attributes might not always be known at the outset, so instead we use
attributes of the roadway that influence capacity and speed, and then calculate
these other values.</p>
<p><strong>Functional Type</strong> or <strong>Functional Class</strong> describes the relative
role each road plays in the transportation system <span class="citation">(<em>A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 7th Edition,</em> <a href="#ref-2018aashto" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Every street
fills a role on a spectrum from mobility on one end to accessibility on the other:
roads that are good at moving high volumes of vehicles are usually not good at
providing access to homes and businesses. Common functional types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Freeways</em> are provided almost exclusively to enhance mobility for through traffic.
Access to freeways is provided only at specific grade-separated interchanges,
with no direct access to the freeway from adjacent land except by way of those
interchanges.</li>
<li>The primary function of major and minor <em>arterials</em> is to provide mobility of through
traffic. However, arterials also connect to both collectors and local roads and
streets and many arterials provide direct access to adjacent development.</li>
<li>Major and minor <em>collectors</em> connect arterials to local roads and provide access
to adjacent development. Mobility for through traffic is less important.</li>
<li><em>Local streets</em> exist primarily to serve adjacent development. Mobility for
through traffic is not important, or even desired.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure <a href="chap-blocks.html#fig:udot-classes">1.2</a> shows roads in Provo and Orem classified by this
scheme. Streets of a functional class below collector are almost never included
in travel models, unless they provide essential connectivity between other
roads. Entire neighborhoods of local streets may be represented by just a
handful of special links called <em>centroid connectors</em>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:udot-classes"></span>
<img src="images/UDOT_Functional_Classes.png" alt="UDOT Functional Classes." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<div class="rmdthink">
<p>Why are local roads not included in travel models?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Free-flow speed</strong> is the speed vehicles travel when the road is empty.
Historically, travel modelers would use formulas in the Highway Capacity Manual
to estimate the free-flow speed for roadways, or assert a basic calculation like
5 miles per hour over the speed limit. More recently, modelers use the speeds
reported from GPS devices in the middle of the night to establish free-flow
speeds.</p>
<p>The number of <strong>lanes</strong> on a road is fairly self-explanatory, but it plays a
major role in the road’s capacity.</p>
<p>Roads located in different <strong>area types</strong> – urban, suburban, and rural –
operate differently from each other. Sometimes travel models will assert this
value, but more recent models will calculate the area type for each link
based on the density of the surrounding TAZs.</p>
<p>Link <strong>capacity</strong> is the maximum number of vehicles a can optimally transport
between two nodes. The capacity is a function of functional type, lanes,
free-flow speed, area type, etc. Usually travel models will calculate the
capacity based on the given values for other roadway characteristics, but
sometimes there are ways to override this feature, i.e., if engineers have
developed specific capacity estimates for a new project.</p>
<p><strong>Centroid connectors</strong> are special links that connect centroids to a network.
These are different from other links in that they usually don’t have a capacity
or a speed (they don’t represent real roads).</p>
</div>
<div id="matrices" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Matrices</h3>
<p>Travel models need to represent travel times, costs, and flows between zones.
Models store this data in <strong>matrices</strong>, special data structures developed for
this purpose. Each matrix is a square table where the rows <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> represent origin
zones and the columns <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> represent the destination zones. Each cell represents
something about the relationship between the two zones.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of information we typically
represent with matrices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cost matrices</strong>, or skims, are matrices where the cells contain estimates of
travel time or cost. They are called <em>skims</em> because they are the results of
<em>skimming</em> a network to find the shortest path between each pair of TAZ
centroids.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flow matrices</strong>, represent flows of people or vehicles from each origin to
each destination. The number in the corresponding cell <span class="math inline">\(T_{ij}\)</span> is the total
number of trips made, and represents the demand between two zones in a network.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="household-travel-surveys-and-population-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Household Travel Surveys and Population Data</h2>
<p>Travel demand models try to represent individual behavior. How many trips
does the average household make per day? How do people respond to changes in
transit fare? And how can a modeler know if the model accurately reflects
total traffic?</p>
<p>Household travel surveys are a critical component of much travel modeling
practice and research, and are a primary way to answer some of these questions.
In a travel survey, a regional planning
agency<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> will recruit households
to participate in the survey. Often there is some kind of reward to encourage
participation, like a gift card or raffle. Once recruited, household members
fill out a diary of their activities on an assigned day; Figure
<a href="chap-blocks.html#fig:travel-diary">1.3</a> shows an example of one activity from a survey diary.
From the example, you can see the kinds of data that are available: where the
person traveled, which travel mode they used, and what was their reason for
making the trip.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:travel-diary"></span>
<img src="images/travel_diary.png" alt="Example travel survey diary entry." width="70%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.3: Example travel survey diary entry.
</p>
</div>
<p>Not all travel surveys are filled in on forms; nowadays telephone interviews or
mobile applications are more common (more on that below). But for decades, paper
travel surveys were the basis of almost all transportation behavior science.</p>
<p>Once the surveys are collected, the data is usually processed into several tables
stored in different files or a database.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Households</strong> table has one row for each household in the dataset, including
information about the number of people in the household, the number of vehicles,
and the household income.</li>
<li>A <strong>Persons</strong> table has one row for each person in the dataset — including
which household they are a part of (to link with the households table) — and
personal attributes like age, student or worker status.</li>
<li>A <strong>Vehicles</strong> table has one row for each vehicle owned by the households in
in the dataset, including attributes like model year, vehicle class, and fuel
efficiency.</li>
<li>A <strong>Trips</strong> table has one row for each trip taken by each person in the dataset.
This table can be linked against the other tables if necessary, and contains
information like the trip purpose and many other elements collected with the form
in Figure <a href="chap-blocks.html#fig:travel-diary">1.3</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tables <a href="chap-blocks.html#tab:show-nhts-hh">1.2</a> through <a href="chap-blocks.html#tab:show-nhts-trips">1.5</a> show
data collected from one household in the 2017 National Household Travel Survey.
The household contains four people, two of whom are working adults in their late
thirties. (the other two are children, and the NHTS did not collect their trip
data). The household has two vehicles, and on the survey travel day person 2
appeared to make a few very long trips. It’s impossible to know if this
is a typical day for this person or not, but that’s the data that was collected.</p>

<p>Note that that the households data in Table <a href="chap-blocks.html#tab:show-nhts-hh">1.2</a> contains a
numeric column called <code>wthhfin</code>. This is a survey <em>weight</em>. Because it is impossible
to sample everyone in a population, there needs to be a way to <em>expand</em> the survey
to the population. What this number means is that the selected household carries
the same <em>weight</em> in this survey as approximately 1100 households in the general
population. Also note that not every household’s weight will be equal; because
some population groups have different survey response weights, some households
will need to be weighted more heavily so that the survey reflects the general
population. Most software packages have functions that allow you to
calculate statistics or estimate models including weighted values. The code
chunk below shows how to calculate the average number of workers per household
with and without weights in R; as you can see, omitting the weights leads
to a substantial change in the survey analysis.</p>

<p>Travel survey methodology is changing rapidly as a result of mobile devices with
location capabilities. First, most travel surveys are now administered through a
mobile application: respondents are invited to install an app on their smartphone
that tracks the respondent’s position and occasionally asks questions about
trip purpose or mode. This makes collecting and cleaning data considerably easier
than traditional paper surveys, and it also lowers the response burden for the
survey participants. Another change that mobile data has brought to travel surveys
is the introduction of large datasets of location information that planners can
purchase directly from cellular providers or third-party providers. Though these
data do not have all the information on demographics and preferences a survey
would provide, they provide a considerably larger and more detailed sample
on things like overall trip flows. As a result, it may be possible to collect
surveys less frequently, or to reduce survey sample sizes.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Continuous and Discrete Distributions</h3>
<p>In general, statistical variables can fall into one of two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Continuous</em> variables can take any numeric value along some range</li>
<li><em>Discrete</em> variables can take some limited set of predetermined values</li>
</ul>
<p>A simplistic definition would be to say that continuous variables are numeric and
discrete variables are non-numeric. A continuous variable has statistics such as
a <em>mean</em>, but these statistics do not make sense on discrete variables. In the
NHTS trips dataset, we can compute a mean trip miles, but we cannot compute
a mean trip purpose. Or we can’t compute a mean that makes sense.</p>

<p>What we can do, however, is we can print a summary table showing the number
of observations that fit in each trip purpose category. Note that sometimes there
will be a category devoted to data that is missing or otherwise invalid.</p>

<p>To this point we’ve only looked at the distribution of one variable at a time.
There are lots of cases where someone might want to consider the <em>joint</em>
distribution of two variables. This joint distribution tells you what is happening
with one variable while the other variable changes. In a table like the one below,
the margins of the table (the row and column sums) contain the single variable
distribution. So sometimes we call these the <em>marginal</em> distributions.</p>

<h2>Lab</h2>
<p>Demographers for the Commonwealth of Virginia — like those in other
states — forecast a certain number of residents, households, and jobs for
many years into the future. But this data alone is not sufficient: We believe
that larger households will make more trips than smaller households.
But we only know how many households and persons there are, and not how many
households of each different size.</p>
<div class="rmdthink">
<p>For example, let’s say that we know there are three households in a zone and nine
persons. Does that mean that there are three 3-person households? Or two one-person
households and one 7-person household? The number and types of trips generated
by these two different scenarios could be very different.</p>
</div>
<p>A <em>household classification</em> model turns these raw counts of households and
persons into distributions of households by size, number of workers, etc. The
Roanoke classification model works in two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The model makes a guess at the distribution by multiplying the average
persons, vehicles, or workers per household in a zone by a marginal distribution
determined from Census tables.</li>
<li>The model then adjusts this initial guess (using <a href="chap-blocks.html#ipf">IPF</a>) so that the
joint distribution of households matches what is currently there.</li>
</ul>
<p>The version of the Roanoke model you have installed contains a classification
model, but the marginal and joint distribution tables the model uses contain
nonsense. Your task for this lab is to correct the values in these tables so
that the model will calculate reasonable estimates of the current and future
population.</p>
<div id="marginal-distributions" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Marginal Distributions</h3>
<p>The United States Census Bureau attempts to count every person in the United
States every ten years. It also surveys a 1% sample of the population each year
for additional statistical questions (in a program called the American Community
Survey), like income and vehicle ownership. In order to protect respondent’s
privacy, Census makes different types of information available at different
geographic levels. For every Census tract in the country, we can get these
marginal distribution tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of households by household size</li>
<li>Number of households by workers per household</li>
<li>Number of households by vehicles available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these data, we can calculate how the average distribution of
households changes based on the average household size in the tract. Figure
<a href="chap-blocks.html#fig:hh-marginal">1.6</a> shows precisely this distribution, using a cubic
polynomial to fit the average distribution. Each set of four points represents
one census tract; for instance, the lowest average household size is in tract
<code>51770001100</code> with 1.37 persons per household on average. This tract shows
71% of its households having 1 member, 25% having 2, and about 2 percent each
of 3 and 4+ person households.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.6: Distribution of households by size, based on average households size.
</p>
</div>
<p>For the most part the distributions make sense, with a few exceptions. It makes
sense that the proportion of 1-person households decreases with average size,
and that the proportion of 4-person households increases. Each of these curves
turns in a weird direction at the end; however, the wide margin on the
distribution means that we’re not really confident about where the actual
proportion is. We’ll need to do some manual adjusting to these curves.</p>
<p>I have provided you with initial marginal distribution curves for the three
marginal distributions of interest. These files are available
<a href="https://byu.box.com/s/gx9s8ylp46qywo9ira9dxv35f31wz5sg">on Box</a>, and the
starting values are shown graphically in Figure <a href="chap-blocks.html#fig:raw-marginals">1.7</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Rules you need to follow when adjusting the curves:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If the average household size is one, then 100% of households must have
one person. The same rule applies to zero workers and zero vehicles.</li>
<li>If the average household size is four, there will still be some households
with only one, two, or three people. This is because the <code>4</code> category really
contains all households with <em>four or more</em> members.</li>
<li>The total proportions across all four marginal curves at each <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> value
must sum to 1.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="joint-distribution" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Joint Distribution</h3>
<p>In the section above we created curves to get the marginal distribution of
household size, vehicles, and workers based on the average in a zone. In order to
make sure that the joint distribution of all of these variables is correct, we
will use IPF with a joint table as the seed. Census does not independently
publish 3-dimensional tables, but the Census Transportation Planning Package
(CTPP) is a partnership between AASHTO and the Census Bureau and it publishes
key tables not available in other places.</p>
<p>The CTPP data is available
<a href="http://data5.ctpp.transportation.org/ctpp1216">through the AASHTO website</a>,
or by searching “CTPP”. Find table <code>A112305</code> for the residence counties where
your group members are from. What do you see in this table? What makes sense
and what does not?</p>
<p>I have already gathered the data and done some preliminary preparation for
you to compute the shares that belong in the household seed file. Run the
code below in an R session (with the <code>tidyverse</code> library loaded) to calculate
the necessary shares. Follow along with the code to understand what is happening.</p>

<h3>Report</h3>
<p>For your homework, you should have a complete run of the uncalibrated, “bare”
RVTPO model. Open the “Trip Generation” submodule by double-clicking on the
yellow box labeled <code>Trip Generation</code>. This submodule has two steps: the
household classification model and the trip productions model. You can run
just this step of the model (and not the entire travel model) by clicking the
“Run Application” button in the top-left of the Cube window and then selecting the
“Run current group only” option in the dialog.</p>
<p>Open the classified socioeconomic data file that is an input to the trip
productions step (the file is named <code>se_classified_2012A.dbf</code>), and make
a tabulation report counting up the number of households in each district in the
following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>W3V0</code> Households with three or more workers and no vehicles.</li>
<li><code>W0V3</code> Households with no workers and three or more vehicles.</li>
<li><code>P2V2</code> Households with two people and two vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The marginal classification curves and the joint distribution seed table are
stored in the <code>params/classification</code> folder. Each file is a <code>.dbf</code> with the
following format:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hh_size_lookup.dbf</code>: <code>[AVG, PERSONS_1, PERSONS_2, PERSONS_3, PERSONS_4]</code></li>
<li><code>hh_workers_lookup.dbf</code>: <code>[AVG, WORKERS_0, WORKERS_1, WORKERS_2, WORKERS_3]</code></li>
<li><code>hh_vehicles_lookup.dbf</code>: <code>[AVG, VEHICLES_0, VEHICLES_1, VEHICLES_2, VEHICLES_3]</code></li>
<li><code>hh_seed.dbf</code>: <code>[WORKERS, PERSONS, VEHICLES, SHARE]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Open these files in Cube, and observe that the data contained them is nonsense.
Replace the files in the <code>params/classification</code> folder with the distributions
you created above, including the marginal distribution curves you calibrated by
hand and the household seed you constructed from CTPP. Run the trip generation
submodule again, and recreate the tabulation report you previously created. Do
these numbers make more sense?</p>
<div class="rmdexample">
<p>You can edit the DBF files in Cube by hand; its copy-paste feature is not what
you would expect from a software program in 2020 (or 2005). A more efficient
way might be to use the <code>write.dbf()</code> function in R.</p>

<p>The classification model incorporates a zone-level IPF process executed in R; the
script for this process is in <code>R/classification.R</code>. Open the script and find
the place where the maximum IPF iterations are set. Change this parameter to 50,
save the R file, and and re-run both the model and your tabulation report.
Change it again to 100 and note the execution time and any changes in the
tabulation report. How many iterations should you run?</p>
<p>Write a lab report describing the household classification model you have
developed. Describe how you developed your marginal disaggregation curves,
including any assertions you employed in smoothing /adjusting the curves.
Include plots of each curve. Describe how you determined the number of
iterations of IPF to run in your model. Compare the distribution of households
by classification category to the joint distribution you obtained from the CTPP.</p>

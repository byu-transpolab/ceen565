# Mode and Destination Choice {#chap-modechoice}



## Homework {-#hw-modechoice}

1. Calculate the Non-motorized Travel Time, Auto Utility, Non-motorized Utility, Auto Probability, Non-motorized Probability, and the Mode Choice Logsum using the following information:

<div align="center">$\beta$<sub>1</sub> = -0.025,
$\beta$<sub>2</sub> = -0.06257,
$\alpha$<sub>1</sub> = 1,
$\alpha$<sub>2</sub> = -1.2258


$$Highway Time = \begin{vmatrix}0.77 & 1.55 & 21.60\\
1.55 & 0.77 & 20.51\\22.02 & 20.93 & 1.21
\end{vmatrix}$$

$$ Highway Distance = \begin{vmatrix}0 & 0.72 & 12.87\\
0.72 & 0 & 12.49\\12.82 & 12.44 & 0
\end{vmatrix}$$


2. Calculate the Utility, Probability, Trips, and Destination Choice Logsum. Check your answer to make sure the rowsum of the Trips is equal to the productions for each row. The Mode Choice Logsum found in Question 1 should be used as the impedance. Use the following information:

<div align="center">$\beta$<sub>2</sub> = 1.1657,
$\alpha$<sub>2</sub> = Attractions

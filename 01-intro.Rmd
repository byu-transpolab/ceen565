## Planning for Human Systems

If you look out on any sufficiently busy road, you will see a steady stream of
vehicles passing by. Each vehicle is largely indistinguishable from the others,
and it is easy as an engineer responsible for that road to see the cars driving
by as little more than an input to a problem. But the *people* inside the cars
should not be indistinguishable from each other. Each person who is driving or
riding in each of those cars has their own reasons to be driving on that road.
One person might be driving to work; one person might be trying to get home to
his or her family. Another car might hold a family going on vacation, or a group
of friends heading to a movie.

If you don't recognize that each person who travels is different, with different
needs and purposes, then it is easy to look only at the **supply** of transportation
infrastructure. Is the road wide enough? Is the traffic signal timed appropriately?
But as with anything in the economy transportation is a function of both supply 
and **demand**. Why are so many people trying to get down this one road *right now*?
Why didn't more people take transit? Why didn't some people choose a different
destination? Or why didn't some people just stay home in the first place? 

Transportation planning therefore must be concerned with both the supply of
infrastructure and the demand for travel. For the most part, economists consider
travel a **derived demand**, which means people only go to the hassle of 
travelling somewhere if they have some other reason to be there. No one 
typically just drives around (with the possible exception of teenagers on a
weekend night); they are going to work, or school, or a social engagement, or
*something*.

Travel demand has not been stable over time. The availability of inexpensive
automobiles in the 20th Century created demand for inter-city and intra-urban
roads that did not exist before. Rising labor force participation rates for
women radically changed the number and types of trips the average household
makes in an average day. Technological developments like teleconferencing and
smartphone-enabled ridehailing could generate different trends. At the same
time, populations in most regions continue to grow. **Planning** for future 
transportation infrastructure is difficult because of the uncertainty of the
future, but it is necessary to keep economies rolling and preseve or improve
quality of life.

In the United States and most societies with some democratic process,
**decisions** about what transportation facilities to build, which policies to
implement, and how to build a city generally fall to **decision makers**. These
decision makers consist of mayors, city councils, planning commissions, 
state legislatures, Congress, state and federal agencies, and innumerable others
who are elected by the public, or who are accountable to others who have been.
In making decisions about how to spend public money on civil infrastructure or
enact tax or other policies, decision makers consult **plans** developed by
professional engineers and planners.

As engineers and planners, we are rarely in a position to *make* decisions, but
we have a responsibility to provide accurate data and technical analysis to 
support decision makers. There is a misconception that transportation planners
must accurately predict the future to be relevant. The purpose of transportation
planning is not to perfectly envision what will happen under every scenario, 
it is to provide information that will help make good decisions now so that
the future is at least as pleasant as the present. We all have hopes for what
our lives and community will look like ten or twenty years from now; it may not
be possible for anyone to provide analysis entirely free of all personal bias.
But as you conduct your work as an engineer and planner, you owe the public your
integrity and competence as you provide information to their representatives.

## The Four-Step Process



## Travel Model Building Blocks

In this section, we present some of the terms used in transportation planning
and modeling, as well as some of the data objects used in constructing travel
demand models.

### Household Travel Surveys
Travel demand models try to represent individual behavior. How many trips
does the average household make per day? How do people respond to changes in 
transit fare? And how can a modeler know if the model accurately reflects 
total traffic?

Household travel surveys are a critical component of much travel modeling
practice and research, and are a primary way to answer some of these questions.
In a travel survey, a regional planning 
agency^[Like a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO).] will recruit households
to participate in the survey. Often there is some kind of reward to encourage
participation, like a gift card or raffle. Once recruited, household members
fill out a diary of their activities on an assigned day; Figure
\@ref(fig:travel-diary) shows an example of one activity from a survey diary.
From the example, you can see the kinds of data that are available: where the 
person traveled, which travel mode they used, and what was their reason for
making the trip.

```{r travel-diary, fig.cap="Example travel survey diary entry.", out.width='70%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/travel_diary.png")
```

Not all travel surveys are filled in on forms; nowadays telephone interviews or
mobile applications are more common (more on that below). But for decades, paper
travel surveys were the basis of almost all transportation behavior science.

Once the surveys are collected, the data is usually processed into several tables
stored in different files or a database. 

  - A **Households** table has one row for each household in the dataset, including
  information about the number of people in the household, the number of vehicles,
  and the household income. 
  - A **Persons** table has one row for each person in the dataset --- including
  which household they are a part of (to link with the households table) --- and
  personal attributes like age, student or worker status. 
  - A **Vehicles** table has one row for each vehicle owned by the households in
  in the dataset, including attributes like model year, vehicle class, and fuel
  efficiency.
  - A **Trips** table has one row for each trip taken by each person in the dataset.
  This table can be linked against the other tables if necessary, and contains
  information like the trip purpose and many other elements collected with the form
  in Figure \@ref(fig:travel-diary).
  
Tables \@ref(tab:show-nhts-hh) through \@ref(tab:show-nhts-trips) show
data collected from one household in the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. 
The household contains four people, two of whom are working adults in their late 
thirties. (the other two are children, and the NHTS did not collect their trip
data). The household has two vehicles, and on the survey travel day person 2
appeared to make a few very long trips. It's impossible to know if this
is a typical day for this person or not, but that's the data that was collected.

```{r show-nhts-hh, echo = FALSE}
nhts_households %>% 
  mutate_at(c("hhfaminc"), ~as_factor(., levels = "labels")) %>%
  filter(houseid == "30000082") %>%
  select(houseid, hhsize, numadlt, wrkcount, hhvehcnt, hhfaminc, wthhfin) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "NHTS Households File")
```

```{r show-nhts-persons, echo = FALSE}
nhts_persons %>% 
  mutate_at(c("educ", "r_sex"), ~as_factor(., levels = "labels")) %>%
  filter(houseid == "30000082") %>%
  select(houseid, personid, r_age, educ, r_sex) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "NHTS Persons File")
```

```{r show-nhts-vehicles, echo = FALSE}
nhts_vehicles %>% 
  mutate_at(c("make", "model", "fueltype"), ~as_factor(., levels = "labels")) %>%
  filter(houseid == "30000082") %>%
  select(houseid, vehid, vehyear, make, model, fueltype, od_read) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "NHTS Vehicles File")
```

```{r show-nhts-trips, echo = FALSE}
nhts_trips %>% 
  mutate_at(c("trptrans", "trippurp"), ~as_factor(., levels = "labels")) %>%
  filter(houseid == "30000082") %>%
  select(houseid, personid, strttime, endtime, trpmiles, trptrans, trippurp) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "NHTS Trips File")
```

Note that that the households data in Table \@ref(tab:show-nhts-hh) contains a
numeric column called `wthhfin`. This is a survey *weight*. Because it is impossible
to sample everyone in a population, there needs to be a way to *expand* the survey
to the population. What this number means is that the selected household carries
the same *weight* in this survey as approximately 1100 households in the general
population. Also note that not every household's weight will be equal; because
some population groups have different survey response weights, some households
will need to be weighted more heavily so that the survey reflects the general 
population. Most software packages have functions that allow you to 
calculate statistics or estimate models including weighted values. The code 
chunk below shows how to calculate the average number of workers per household
with and without weights in R; as you can see, omitting the weights leads
to a substantial change in the survey analysis.

```{r weighted-mean, echo = TRUE}
# Average workers per household with no weights
mean(nhts_households$wrkcount)
# Average workers per household, weighted
weighted.mean(nhts_households$wrkcount, nhts_households$wthhfin)
```


Travel survey methodology is changing rapidly as a result of mobile devices with
location capabilities. First, most travel surveys are now administered through a
mobile application: respondents are invited to install an app on their smartphone
that tracks the respondent's position and occasionally asks questions about
trip purpose or mode. This makes collecting and cleaning data considerably easier
than traditional paper surveys, and it also lowers the response burden for the
survey participants.  Another change that mobile data has brought to travel surveys
is the introduction of large datasets of location information that planners can
purchase directly from cellular providers or third-party providers. Though these
data do not have all the information on demographics and preferences a survey 
would provide, they provide a considerably larger and more detailed sample 
on things like overall trip flows. As a result, it may be possible to collect
surveys less frequently, or to reduce survey sample sizes.

## Statistical and Mathematical Techniques

Many elements of travel modeling and forecasting require complex numerical and
quantitative techniques. In this section we will present some of these techniques.

### Continuous and Discrete Distributions

In general, statistical variables can fall into one of two categories:

  - *Continuous* variables can take any numeric value along some range
  - *Discrete* variables can take some limited set of predetermined values

A simplistic definition would be to say that continuous variables are numeric and
discrete variables are non-numeric. A continuous variable has statistics such as 
a *mean*, but these statistics do not make sense on discrete variables. In the
NHTS trips dataset, we can compute a mean trip miles, but we cannot compute
a mean trip purpose. Or we can't compute a mean that makes sense.

```{r dc_mean, echo = TRUE, error=TRUE}
# mean of continuous variable: trip length
weighted.mean(nhts_trips$trpmiles, nhts_trips$wttrdfin)
# mean of categorical variable: trip purpose
weighted.mean(nhts_trips$trippurp, nhts_trips$wttrdfin)
```

What we can do, however, is we can print a summary table showing the number
of observations that fit in each trip purpose category. Note that sometimes there
will be a category devoted to data that is missing or otherwise invalid.

```{r dc_categories, echo = TRUE}
table(nhts_trips$trippurp)
```

Sometimes it is handy to split a continuous variable into categories so that you 
can treat it as a discrete variable.

```{r dc-cut, echo = TRUE}
nhts_trips$miles_cat <- cut(nhts_trips$trpmiles, breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, Inf))
table(nhts_trips$miles_cat)
```


When we visualize the distribution of a continuous variable, we might
use a histogram or density plot, but with a discrete variable we would use 
a bar chart.

```{r dc-histogram, echo = TRUE, fig.cap="Visualizing a continuous distribution with a histogram.", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(nhts_trips, aes(x = trpmiles, weight = wttrdfin)) +
  geom_histogram() + xlab("Trip Distance [Miles]") + ylab("Weighted Trips") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 50))
```

```{r dc-barchart, echo = TRUE, fig.cap="Visualizing a discrete distribution with a bar chart.", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(nhts_trips, aes(x = as_factor(trippurp, levels = "labels"), 
                       weight = wttrdfin)) +
  geom_bar() + xlab("Trip Purpose") + ylab("Weighted Trips") 
```


To this point we've only looked at the distribution of one variable at a time.
There are lots of cases where someone might want to consider the *joint* 
distribution of two variables. This joint distribution tells you what is happening
with one variable while the other variable changes. In a table like the one below,
the margins of the table (the row and column sums) contain the single variable
distribution. So sometimes we call these the *marginal* distributions.

```{r dc-joint}
table(nhts_trips$miles_cat, nhts_trips$trippurp)
```

We can visualize joint distributions as well, and sometimes the results are
quite nice.

```{r dc-joint-hist, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(nhts_trips %>% 
         mutate(trippurp =as_factor(trippurp, levels = "labels")) %>%
         filter(trippurp != "Not ascertained"), 
         aes(fill = trippurp, x = trpmiles, weight = wttrdfin)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  xlab("Trip Distance [log miles]") +  ylab("Density of Trips") +
  scale_color_discrete("Trip Purpose") + scale_x_log10(limits = c(0.1, 100)) 
```

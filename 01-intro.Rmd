## Planning for Human Systems

If you look out on any sufficiently busy road, you will see a steady stream of
vehicles passing by. Each vehicle is largely indistinguishable from the others,
and it is easy as an engineer responsible for that road to see the cars driving
by as little more than an input to a problem. But the *people* inside the cars
should not be indistinguishable from each other. Each person who is driving or
riding in each of those cars has their own reasons to be driving on that road.
One person might be driving to work; one person might be trying to get home to
his or her family. Another car might hold a family going on vacation, or a group
of friends heading to a movie.

If you don't recognize that each person who travels is different, with different
needs and purposes, then it is easy to look only at the **supply** of transportation
infrastructure. Is the road wide enough? Is the traffic signal timed appropriately?
But as with anything in the economy transportation is a function of both supply 
and **demand**. Why are so many people trying to get down this one road *right now*?
Why didn't more people take transit? Why didn't some people choose a different
destination? Or why didn't some people just stay home in the first place? 

Transportation planning therefore must be concerned with both the supply of
infrastructure and the demand for travel. For the most part, economists consider
travel a **derived demand**, which means people only go to the hassle of 
traveling somewhere if they have some other reason to be there. No one 
typically just drives around (with the possible exception of teenagers on a
weekend night); they are going to work, or school, or a social engagement, or
*something*.

Travel demand has not been stable over time. The availability of inexpensive
automobiles in the 20th Century created demand for inter-city and intra-urban
roads that did not exist before. Rising labor force participation rates for
women radically changed the number and types of trips the average household
makes in an average day. Technological developments like teleconferencing and
smartphone-enabled ridehailing could generate different trends. At the same
time, populations in most regions continue to grow. **Planning** for future 
transportation infrastructure is difficult because of the uncertainty of the
future, but it is necessary to keep economies rolling and preserve or improve
quality of life.

In the United States and most societies with some democratic process,
**decisions** about what transportation facilities to build, which policies to
implement, and how to build a city generally fall to **decision makers**. These
decision makers consist of mayors, city councils, planning commissions, 
state legislatures, Congress, state and federal agencies, and innumerable others
who are elected by the public, or who are accountable to others who have been.
In making decisions about how to spend public money on civil infrastructure or
enact tax or other policies, decision makers consult **plans** developed by
professional engineers and planners.

As engineers and planners, we are rarely in a position to *make* decisions, but
we have a responsibility to provide accurate data and technical analysis to 
support decision makers. There is a misconception that transportation planners
must accurately predict the future to be relevant. The purpose of transportation
planning is not to perfectly envision what will happen under every scenario, 
it is to provide information that will help make good decisions now so that
the future is at least as pleasant as the present. We all have hopes for what
our lives and community will look like ten or twenty years from now; it may not
be possible for anyone to provide analysis entirely free of all personal bias.
But as you conduct your work as an engineer and planner, you owe the public your
integrity and competence as you provide information to their representatives.

## The Four-Step Transportation Planning Process

How can you know what might happen in the future? And how might that change based
on decisions that you make today? This basic question is at the heart of 
transportation planning:

  - What might traffic look like if we build nothing and population still grows?
  - Can we build less if we change land development patterns?
  - How many people will use this new transit line?
  
In many fields --- including politics, meteorology, economics, etc. ---
professionals who seek answers to questions like this do so with the help of a 
**model**. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-world system. 
In any model, there are things that need to vary (called inputs), things that
can be estimated or calibrated (called parameters), and results (called outputs). 
There are also things that are held fixed. The specific mathematical structure
of the model, and which things get included and which things are excluded or
abstracted away, determine what the model should and should not be used for.

For example, we might try to predict something with a linear model, 
\begin{equation}
  y = \alpha + \beta x + \varepsilon
  (\#eq:basic-model)
\end{equation}
In this case $y$ is the output, $x$ is the input, the 
$\beta$ parameter defines how the input influences the outcomes, $\alpha$ is a
fixed value, and $\varepsilon$ accounts for the random influence of all the 
factors we did not include. We could add more $\beta$ and $x$ terms to 
include more factors in the model. We could also change the mathematical format
of the model to represent different types of outcomes, or chain several smaller
models together to represent more complex relationships. If we wanted to see what 
might happen if $x$ changed, we could put in a new value into this equation 
and the output result $y$ might be a plausible prediction. The plausibility of
the output is a function of how well the mathematical model actually represents
the reality of the system.

In this class you will learn the details of the *travel demand modeling process*, 
which is a chain of many models, each with different inputs and outputs. A
travel demand model on the whole has two basic inputs:

 - Socioeconomic data representing where people live and work and go to school and
 do other things.
 - Transportation network data representing the roads and transit services and
 other methods people use to get between their activities.
 
The basic outputs of a travel demand model are transportation volumes and levels
of service. There are many ways to design and build travel demand models, but
the traditional way most regions in the United States approach travel demand models
is through a **four step**, trip-based^[The primary alternative to the four-step method is called an "activity-based" method. Activity-based models can be significantly more complex to construct and use, but they are based more concretely in human behavior. Whether they actually result in better decisions by transportation planning agencies is an open question.] process. The four steps are:

 1. Trip Generation
 2. Trip Distribution
 3. Mode Choice
 4. Route Assignment
 
A *trip generation* model determines how many trips are produced in each *zone*
(neighborhood), and how many trips are attracted to each zone. The inputs to
this model is the socioeconomic data in each zone. Mathematically, trip generation
can be represented as 
\begin{equation}
  P_i = f(SE_i), A_j = f(SE_j)
  (\#eq:tripgen)
\end{equation}
where $i$ and $j$ are the production and destination zone indexes.

A *trip distribution* model seeks to pair the productions and attractions in the
zones based on the travel costs $c$ between the two zones. Mathematically, trip
distribution can be represented as
\begin{equation}
  T_{ij} = f(P_i, A_j, c_{ij})
  (\#eq:tripdist)
\end{equation}

A *mode choice* model estimates how many of the trips from $i$ to $j$ will happen
on each available mode $k$, based on the travel time by each mode and other 
attributes of the origin and destination zones. Mathematically,
\begin{equation}
  T_{ijk} = f(T_{ij}, c_{ijk}, SE_{i,j}) 
  (\#eq:modechoice)
\end{equation}

A *route assignment* model determines the specific routes that the trips going
between $i$ and $j$ take. This allows us to estimate the volume of level of 
service on each highway link and transit system $l$. Mathematically,
\begin{equation}
  LOS_l, V_l = f(T_{ijk}, c_{ijk})
  (\#eq:modechoice)
\end{equation}

On the whole, the travel demand model can be represented mathematically as a 
single function where the output transportation volumes and levels of service
are a function of the input socioeconomic information and travel costs.

\begin{equation}
  LOS_l, V_l = \mathcal{F}(SE_{i,j}, c_{ij})
  (\#eq:tdm)
\end{equation}

The details of each of these models will be the topic for the next several 
chapters.

## Travel Model Building Blocks

In this section, we present some of the terms used in transportation planning
and modeling, as well as some of the data objects used in constructing travel
demand models.


### Travel Analysis Zones and SE Data

The "people" in a model conduct *activities*: work, school, recreation, and
other activities. Because travel is a derived demand, the purpose of travel is to 
move between these activities. So a travel model needs a way to represent where
the households, persons, jobs, and activities are located in space.

Activities in travel demand models happen in **Travel Analysis Zones** (TAZs). 
The model tries to represent trips between the TAZs. Because trips inside a
TAZ --- called intrazonal trips --- are not included in the travel model, each
TAZ should be sufficiently small such that these trips do not affect the models'
ability to forecast travel on roadways.  The following rules are helpful when
drawing TAZ's:

   - The TAZ should not stretch across major roadways
   - The TAZ should contain principally one land use, though in some areas this
   is not possible.
   - In areas with more dense population, the TAZ should be smaller.

Each TAZ is associated with **socioeconomic** (SE)  data, or information about
the people, businesses, and other activities that are located in the TAZ. 
**Households** are a basic unit of analysis in many economic and statistical
analyses. A household typically consists of one or more **persons** who reside
in the same dwelling. Individuals living in the same dwelling can make up a
family or other group of individuals; that is, a group of roommates is 
considered a household. Not everyone lives in households, however; some people 
live in what are called group quarters: military barracks, college dormitories,
monasteries, prisons, etc. Travel models need to handle these people as well, but
in this class we will focus on people who live in households.

Households in travel models are often grouped into a classification scheme
based on the number of people in the household, the number of children, the number
of vehicles, etc. Households of different classifications will have different
behavior in the rest of the model.

::::{.rmdthink}
Your lab activity for this unit will walk you through specifying a
household classification model.
::::

**Firms** are another basic unit of analysis in many economic and statistical
analyses. A firm is a profit-seeking person or entity that provides goods or
services in exchange for monetary transactions. A firm can provide raw resources,
manufactured resources, other services, or be a place of employment. In some
cases, a firm may be another household. Each firm will have an *industry* type. 
Examples of industry types include office, service, manufacturing, retail, etc.
In many SE data files, firms are simply represented as the total number of 
jobs in a TAZ belonging to each industry.  Other **Institutions** including
academic, government, and non-profit entities will also be represented in the SE
data in terms of their jobs.

It is important to be precise in our definitions when put all of these different
items into an analysis. A typical socioeconomic data table for a small region is
given in Table \@ref(tab:setable). Note the following relationships:

  - Persons live in Households
  - Workers are Persons who have a Job
  - Firms have employees who work at a Jobs 

```{r RoanokeTAZ, fig.cap="Travel Analysis Zones in Central Roanoke.", out.width='100%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RoanokeTAZ.png")
```

When we talk about "how many jobs" are in a TAZ, we mean "How many people do
the firms located in that TAZ employ," and not "how many people who live
in that TAZ are workers."

```{r setable, echo = FALSE}
se_nrow <- 3
tibble(
  taz = 1:se_nrow, persons = sample(30:50, se_nrow), 
  hh = round(persons * rnorm(se_nrow, 0.8, 0.3)),
  workers = round(persons * rnorm(se_nrow, 0.4, 0.1)),
  retail = sample(100:150, se_nrow), office = sample(50:100, se_nrow),
  manufacturing = c(2, 11, 0)
) %>% knitr::kable(caption = "Example SE Table")
```


::::{.rmdexample}
Alice lives with her husband in zone $A$ and works as an accountant in zone $B$.
Her husband does not currently work.
Fill out the SE table from Table \@ref(tab:setable) with *just* this 
household's information.

Two persons live in one household with one worker in zone A. The firm Alice works at 
has an office job for her in Zone B.

| taz | persons | hh         | workers | retail | office | manufacturing |
|-----|---------|------------|---------|--------|--------|---------------|
| A   |     2   |         1  |        1|        |        |               |
| B   |         |            |         |        |       1|               |

::::


### Transportation Networks 

The purpose of a travel model is to understand how people are likely to use
transportation infrastructure, so there has to be a way to represent 
roadway and transit systems. We do this with a 
*network*^[Sometimes called a *graph* in mathematics.]. A network consists of
two basic data structures: **Nodes** and **Links**

Nodes are points in space. In a highway network, almost all nodes represent 
intersections between different roads. Some important nodes represent the 
**TAZ Centroids**, or the points where the households and jobs in the travel
model are located.

Links connect nodes, and represent roads. Links have many different attributes
describing the characteristics of the roadway they represent. The two most 
important link attributes are the link's *speed* and *capacity*, because they
provide the travel costs ($c_{ij}$ above) to the various steps of the model. But
these attributes might not always be known at the outset, so instead we use
attributes of the roadway that influence capacity and speed, and then calculate 
these other values.

**Functional Type** or **Functional Class** describes the relative
role each road plays in the transportation system [@2018aashto]. Every street
fills a role on a spectrum from mobility on one end to accessibility on the other: 
roads that are good at moving high volumes of vehicles are usually not good at 
providing access to homes and businesses. Common functional types include:

  - *Freeways* are provided almost exclusively to enhance mobility for through traffic.
    Access to freeways is provided only at specific grade-separated interchanges,
    with no direct access to the freeway from adjacent land except by way of those 
    interchanges.
  - The primary function of major and minor *arterials* is to provide mobility of through 
    traffic. However, arterials also connect to both collectors and local roads and
    streets and many arterials provide direct access to adjacent development. 
  - Major and minor *collectors* connect arterials to local roads and provide access
    to adjacent development. Mobility for through traffic is less important. 
  - *Local streets* exist primarily to serve adjacent development. Mobility for 
    through traffic is not important, or even desired.
  
Figure \@ref(fig:udot-classes) shows roads in Provo and Orem classified by this
scheme. Streets of a functional class below collector are almost never included
in travel models, unless they provide essential connectivity between other
roads. Entire neighborhoods of local streets may be represented by just a
handful of special links called *centroid connectors*.

```{r udot-classes, fig.cap="UDOT Functional Classes.", out.width='100%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/UDOT_Functional_Classes.png")
```

::::{.rmdthink}
Why are local roads not included in travel models?
::::

**Free-flow speed** is the speed vehicles travel when the road is empty.
Historically, travel modelers would use formulas in the Highway Capacity Manual
to estimate the free-flow speed for roadways, or assert a basic calculation like
5 miles per hour over the speed limit. More recently, modelers use the speeds 
reported from GPS devices in the middle of the night to establish free-flow 
speeds.

The number of **lanes** on a road is fairly self-explanatory, but it plays a 
major role in the road's capacity.

Roads located in different **area types** -- urban, suburban, and rural -- 
operate differently from each other. Sometimes travel models will assert this 
value, but more recent models will calculate the area type for each link
based on the density of the surrounding TAZs. 

Link **capacity** is the maximum number of vehicles a can optimally transport
between two nodes.  The capacity is a function of functional type, lanes,
free-flow speed, area type, etc. Usually travel models will calculate the
capacity based on the given values for other roadway characteristics, but
sometimes there are ways to override this feature, i.e., if engineers have
developed specific capacity estimates for a new project.

**Centroid connectors** are special links that connect centroids to a network. 
These are different from other links in that they usually don't have a capacity
or a speed (they don't represent real roads).

### Matrices

Travel models need to represent travel times, costs, and flows between zones.
Models store this data in **matrices**, special data structures developed for 
this purpose. Each matrix is a square table where the rows $i$ represent origin
zones and the columns $j$ represent the destination zones. Each cell represents
something about the relationship between the two zones.

There are two kinds of information we typically
represent with matrices:

  - **Cost matrices**, or skims, are matrices where the cells contain estimates of
  travel time or cost. They are called *skims* because they are the results of
  *skimming* a network to find the shortest path between each pair of TAZ
  centroids.

  - **Flow matrices**, represent flows of people or vehicles from each origin to
  each destination. The number in the corresponding cell $T_{ij}$ is the total
  number of trips made, and represents the demand between two zones in a network.


## Data Inputs

In the last section we discussed data *structures* like highway networks and
socioeconomic data files. In this section, we are going to talk about the data
*inputs* that can be used for developing travel models. Besides highway networks
 --- which usually have to be supplied by the transportation agency --- modelers
frequently gather data from household travel surveys and the US Census Bureau.


::::{.rmdthink}
Obtaining an accurate highway network is one of the most difficult tasks in 
travel modeling. It's not conceptually or intellectually difficult, but it is 
very difficult to map model networks onto the linear referencing systems or
GIS files used by other agency departments. This is made even more
difficult by model networks needing to be *routeable*: common GIS formats 
like shapefiles have no way of representing routability. 
::::

### Household Travel Surveys

Travel demand models try to represent individual behavior. How many trips
does the average household make per day? How do people respond to changes in 
transit fare? And how can a modeler know if the model accurately reflects 
total traffic?

Household travel surveys are a critical component of much travel modeling
practice and research, and are a primary way to answer some of these questions.
In a travel survey, a regional planning 
agency^[Like a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO).] will recruit households
to participate in the survey. Often there is some kind of reward to encourage
participation, like a gift card or raffle. Once recruited, household members
fill out a diary of their activities on an assigned day; Figure
\@ref(fig:travel-diary) shows an example of one activity from a survey diary.
From the example, you can see the kinds of data that are available: where the 
person traveled, which travel mode they used, and what was their reason for
making the trip.

```{r travel-diary, fig.cap="Example travel survey diary entry.", out.width='70%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/travel_diary.png")
```

Not all travel surveys are filled in on forms; nowadays telephone interviews or
mobile applications are more common (more on that below). But for decades, paper
travel surveys were the basis of almost all transportation behavior science.

Once the surveys are collected, the data is usually processed into several tables
stored in different files or a database. 

  - A **Households** table has one row for each household in the dataset, including
  information about the number of people in the household, the number of vehicles,
  and the household income. 
  - A **Persons** table has one row for each person in the dataset --- including
  which household they are a part of (to link with the households table) --- and
  personal attributes like age, student or worker status. 
  - A **Vehicles** table has one row for each vehicle owned by the households in
  in the dataset, including attributes like model year, vehicle class, and fuel
  efficiency.
  - A **Trips** table has one row for each trip taken by each person in the dataset.
  This table can be linked against the other tables if necessary, and contains
  information like the trip purpose and many other elements collected with the form
  in Figure \@ref(fig:travel-diary).
  
Tables \@ref(tab:show-nhts-hh) through \@ref(tab:show-nhts-trips) show
data collected from one household in the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. 
The household contains four people, two of whom are working adults in their late 
thirties. (the other two are children, and the NHTS did not collect their trip
data). The household has two vehicles, and on the survey travel day person 2
appeared to make a few very long trips. It's impossible to know if this
is a typical day for this person or not, but that's the data that was collected.

```{r show-nhts-hh, echo = FALSE}
nhts_households %>% 
  mutate_at(c("hhfaminc"), ~as_factor(., levels = "labels")) %>%
  filter(houseid == "30000082") %>%
  select(houseid, hhsize, numadlt, wrkcount, hhvehcnt, hhfaminc, wthhfin) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "NHTS Households File")
```

```{r show-nhts-persons, echo = FALSE}
nhts_persons %>% 
  mutate_at(c("educ", "r_sex"), ~as_factor(., levels = "labels")) %>%
  filter(houseid == "30000082") %>%
  select(houseid, personid, r_age, educ, r_sex) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "NHTS Persons File")
```

```{r show-nhts-vehicles, echo = FALSE}
nhts_vehicles %>% 
  mutate_at(c("make", "model", "fueltype"), ~as_factor(., levels = "labels")) %>%
  filter(houseid == "30000082") %>%
  select(houseid, vehid, vehyear, make, model, fueltype, od_read) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "NHTS Vehicles File")
```

```{r show-nhts-trips, echo = FALSE}
nhts_trips %>% 
  mutate_at(c("trptrans", "trippurp"), ~as_factor(., levels = "labels")) %>%
  filter(houseid == "30000082") %>%
  select(houseid, personid, strttime, endtime, trpmiles, trptrans, trippurp) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "NHTS Trips File")
```

Note that that the households data in Table \@ref(tab:show-nhts-hh) contains a
numeric column called `wthhfin`. This is a survey *weight*. Because it is impossible
to sample everyone in a population, there needs to be a way to *expand* the survey
to the population. What this number means is that the selected household carries
the same *weight* in this survey as approximately 1100 households in the general
population. Also note that not every household's weight will be equal; because
some population groups have different survey response weights, some households
will need to be weighted more heavily so that the survey reflects the general 
population. Most software packages have functions that allow you to 
calculate statistics or estimate models including weighted values. The code 
chunk below shows how to calculate the average number of workers per household
with and without weights in R; as you can see, omitting the weights leads
to a substantial change in the survey analysis.

```{r weighted-mean, echo = TRUE}
# Average workers per household with no weights
mean(nhts_households$wrkcount)
# Average workers per household, weighted
weighted.mean(nhts_households$wrkcount, nhts_households$wthhfin)
```


Travel survey methodology is changing rapidly as a result of mobile devices with
location capabilities. First, most travel surveys are now administered through a
mobile application: respondents are invited to install an app on their smartphone
that tracks the respondent's position and occasionally asks questions about
trip purpose or mode. This makes collecting and cleaning data considerably easier
than traditional paper surveys, and it also lowers the response burden for the
survey participants.  Another change that mobile data has brought to travel surveys
is the introduction of large datasets of location information that planners can
purchase directly from cellular providers or third-party providers. Though these
data do not have all the information on demographics and preferences a survey 
would provide, they provide a considerably larger and more detailed sample 
on things like overall trip flows. As a result, it may be possible to collect
surveys less frequently, or to reduce survey sample sizes.

### US Census Bureau

The primary statistical agency of the United States is the U.S. Census Bureau, 
called Census. The need to collect statistics is established in the Constitution,

> Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which
may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers...
The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting
of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in
such Manner as they shall by Law direct. 

Since the first census in 1790, Census has collected more data than simply the
number of people in each state. Current programs that are especially important
for travel modeling and other related demographic research include:

  - The *Decennial Census of Population and Housing* is the thing most people
  think of when they think of Census. Every ten years (most recently in 2020), 
  Census attempts to collect the number, age, and other key population attributes
  for every dwelling unit in the United States. 
  - The *American Community Survey* (ACS) is an annual 1% sample of the US population.
  This survey is considerably more detailed than the decennial census, and asks
  questions regarding the education and income of household members, how each
  worker traveled to work, whether people own or rent their home, etc.

The ACS is a particularly useful data set, especially because the decennial
census can become outdated as ten years go by between collections. To protect
the individual identity of ACS respondents, Census engages in a number of
different schemes.

The simplest scheme is data aggregation. ACS data is usually obtained as tables
representing the number of individuals or households in a geographic area that
match a certain category. The data is aggregated in two ways: First, large geographic 
areas are aggregated each year, meaning that up-to-date numbers are always 
available; Second, smaller geographic areas contain groups of records collected 
over the last five years. In this way there is a tradeoff between temporal and
spatial precision that the researcher needs to consider.

Another basic scheme is **top-coding**, where numeric variables are capped at a common
value. The ACS will report how many people in a neighborhood have an income
over $250,000, but not how many have an income over 
$1 million. Census will also **suppress** small counts in a category; they will
not reveal how many households have 8, 9, or 10 people, instead collapsing all
of these households into a "seven or more" group. If too few individuals or
households match that category, Census does not provide a count. For example, if
only one household in a neighborhood makes more than $250,000, the ACS table for
that cell will contain no information. That could mean there are zero, one,
four, or some other small number of households
in that category.

Besides tables, the Census releases the ACS Public Use Micro-Sample (PUMS) 
containing ACS responses as disaggregate *microdata*. These data are
geographically located to much larger areas than other ACS records, and Census
does imputation and data swapping on the records to ensure that private 
information cannot be disclosed. But studies conducted on ACS PUMS records 
reach the same statistical conclusions as studies conducted on the unmodeled and
raw data, making PUMS a useful tool in studying populations.

#### Geographies

Census data are given in a geographical heirarchy:

  - State
  - County
  - Tract
  - Block Group
  - Block

The bottom three layers are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:censusgeos). Each layer
nests completely within the layer above it. More detailed data is available
at less spatially detailed geographies.

## Statistical and Mathematical Techniques

Many elements of travel modeling and forecasting require complex numerical and
quantitative techniques. In this section we will present some of these techniques.
Many of the data tables are in the `nhts2017` package. To install this package, 
follow the directions in the [Appendix](#app-rstudio).


### Continuous and Discrete Distributions

In general, statistical variables can fall into one of two categories:

  - *Continuous* variables can take any numeric value along some range
  - *Discrete* variables can take some limited set of predetermined values

A simplistic definition would be to say that continuous variables are numeric and
discrete variables are non-numeric. A continuous variable has statistics such as 
a *mean*, but these statistics do not make sense on discrete variables. In the
NHTS trips dataset, we can compute a mean trip miles, but we cannot compute
a mean trip purpose. Or we can't compute a mean that makes sense.

```{r dc_mean, echo = TRUE, error=TRUE}
# mean of continuous variable: trip length
weighted.mean(nhts_trips$trpmiles, nhts_trips$wttrdfin)
# mean of categorical variable: trip purpose
weighted.mean(nhts_trips$trippurp, nhts_trips$wttrdfin)
```

What we can do, however, is we can print a summary table showing the number
of observations that fit in each trip purpose category. Note that sometimes there
will be a category devoted to data that is missing or otherwise invalid.

```{r dc_categories, echo = TRUE}
table(nhts_trips$trippurp)
```

Sometimes it is handy to split a continuous variable into categories so that you 
can treat it as a discrete variable.

```{r dc-cut, echo = TRUE}
nhts_trips$miles_cat <- cut(nhts_trips$trpmiles, breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, Inf))
table(nhts_trips$miles_cat)
```


When we visualize the distribution of a continuous variable, we might
use a histogram or density plot, but with a discrete variable we would use 
a bar chart.

```{r dc-histogram, echo = TRUE, fig.cap="Visualizing a continuous distribution with a histogram.", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(nhts_trips, aes(x = trpmiles, weight = wttrdfin)) +
  geom_histogram() + xlab("Trip Distance [Miles]") + ylab("Weighted Trips") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 50))
```

```{r dc-barchart, echo = TRUE, fig.cap="Visualizing a discrete distribution with a bar chart.", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(nhts_trips, aes(x = as_factor(trippurp, levels = "labels"), 
                       weight = wttrdfin)) +
  geom_bar() + xlab("Trip Purpose") + ylab("Weighted Trips") 
```


To this point we've only looked at the distribution of one variable at a time.
There are lots of cases where someone might want to consider the *joint* 
distribution of two variables. This joint distribution tells you what is happening
with one variable while the other variable changes. In a table like the one below,
the margins of the table (the row and column sums) contain the single variable
distribution. So sometimes we call these the *marginal* distributions.

```{r dc-joint}
table(nhts_trips$miles_cat, nhts_trips$trippurp)
```

We can visualize joint distributions as well, and sometimes the results are
quite nice.

```{r dc-joint-hist, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(nhts_trips %>% 
         mutate(trippurp =as_factor(trippurp, levels = "labels")) %>%
         filter(trippurp != "Not ascertained"), 
         aes(fill = trippurp, x = trpmiles, weight = wttrdfin)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  xlab("Trip Distance [log miles]") +  ylab("Density of Trips") +
  scale_color_discrete("Trip Purpose") + scale_x_log10(limits = c(0.1, 100)) 
```



### Iterative Proportional Fitting {#ipf}

There are times when we know two marginal distributions but do not know the 
joint distribution. This can happen for a number of reasons:

  - We know how many households of different sizes and workers, but not how
  many large households have multiple workers.
  - We have a forecast of truck volumes at external roads, but do not know
  how many trucks go between the roads.
  
In these situations, a convenient technique is *iterative proportional fitting*.
This technique updates a joint distribution to match two or more marginal 
distributions within a particular tolerance.  IPF is complicated to explain but
easy to demonstrate, so let's go straight into an example.

Let's say we have a forecast for AADT at three external stations in the future.
We can assume that the two-way AADT is roughly even in each direction, so the
inbound volume at each station is half the AADT. Let's  also say we have an
estimate of where the trips coming at those stations *today* go today. This 
matrix is called a **seed**.

```{r ipf-1, echo = TRUE}
# AADT projections
volumes <- tibble(
  Station = LETTERS[1:3],
  Volume = c(20000, 30000, 35000),
  AADT = Volume * 2
)
volumes

# observed distribution for a seed
seed <- matrix(c( 0,	7501	,12500, 8956,	0, 11879, 9146,	21044,	4687),
               nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(seed) <- colnames(seed) <- volumes$Station
seed
```

Note that the row and column sums of the matrix do not match the forecast.
But we can multiply each row in the matrix by the new volume estimate and the
proportion of the seed matrix row that is in that cell. This gives us a new 
estimate of the cell's value. Mathematically,

\begin{equation}
  S_{n+1, ij} = \frac{m_i * S_{n, ij} }{\sum_{i}S_{ij}}
  (\#eq:ipf)
\end{equation}

Where $S$ is the seed matrix and $m$ is the marginal vector. We then repeat with
the other marginal, 

\begin{equation}
  S_{n+2, ij} = \frac{m_j * S_{n, ij} }{\sum_{j}S_{ij}}
  (\#eq:ipf2)
\end{equation}

In this example case, the first row is

\begin{align*}
  S_{1, 1 1} &= 20000 * 0 / 20001  &= 0\\
  S_{1, 1 2} &= 20000 * 7501 / 20001  &= 7500.62\\
  S_{1, 1 2} &= 20000 * 12500/ 20001  &= 12499.38\\
\end{align*}

And the whole row iteration is
```{r ipf-row}
# get factor to multiply each row by
row_factor <- volumes$Volume / rowSums(seed)
# multiply across rows, see ?sweep()
sweep(seed, 1, row_factor, "*")
```

We can write a function that does a complete round of row, then column fitting.

```{r ipf-round}
ipf_round <- function(marginal1, marginal2, seed) {
  # multiply the first marginal through the rows
  seed_rows <- sweep(seed, 1, marginal1 / rowSums(seed), "*")
  # multiply the second marginal through the columns
  seed_cols <- sweep(seed_rows, 1, marginal2 / colSums(seed_rows), "*")
  # return
  seed_cols
}

ipf_round(volumes$Volume, volumes$Volume, seed)
```

If we repeat this process for several iterations, we can see that the change 
between successive values shrinks. We can use this change to set a tolerance
for when we want the process to stop. In this case, we get very close after
just one iteration.

```{r ipf-repeat}
change <- vector("numeric")
joint <- seed
for(i in 1:5){
  # update joint table
  new_joint <- ipf_round(volumes$Volume, volumes$Volume, joint)
  # calculate absolute error at this iteration
  print(sum(abs(new_joint - joint)))
  # update joint
  joint <- new_joint
}

# final estimate
new_joint
```


A few notes:

  - IPF is not guaranteed to progressively converge. Meaning, it is possible to get 
  stuck in a loop where the successive change between iterations does not get 
  smaller. It is important to set a maximum number of iterations. In our example,
  a tolerance of `1e10` would be reached after one iteration, but a tolerance 
  of `1e16` could never be achieved.
  - If a cell in a seed matrix has a zero value, all successive iterations will
  have zero. If the seed table has a structural zero, keep it in. Otherwise, you
  might want to consider overriding the value with a small number.
  - The process is not consistent: A different seed matrix will lead to a different
  outcome. If you are uncertain about your seed matrix, you could consider 
  taking the average of multiple potential seed matrices.

## Homework {-#hw-blocks}

> Some of these questions require a completed run of the demonstration model.
For instructions on accessing and running the model, see the [Appendix](#app-demomodel)

1. With the TAZ layer and socioeconomic data in the demonstration model, make a
set of choropleth and / or bar chart maps showing the following socioeconomic 
variables: 
    - total households
    - household density (per acre)
    - total jobs
    - job density
    - share of manufacturing vs office vs retail employment
    
    Compare your maps with aerial imagery from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap.
Describe the spatial patterns of the socioeconomic data in the model region.
Identify which zones constitute the central business district, and identify any
outlying employment centers.

1. With the highway network layer, create maps
showing: link functional type; link free flow speed; and link hourly capacity.
Compare your maps with aerial imagery from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Note
that the hourly capacity is not on the input network, so you will need to use a
either the loaded highway network that is output from the model, or an
intermediate network after the initial highway capacity calculations.
Identify the major freeways and principal arterials in the model region. 
   
1. Find the shortest free-flow speed path along the network between two zones.
Then find the shortest *distance* path between the same two zones. Are the paths the
same? Do the paths match what an online mapping service shows for a trip in the
middle of the night?

1. Open the highway assignment report, which shows vehicle hours and miles
traveled by facility type. What percent of the region's VMT occurs on freeways?
What percent of the region's lane-miles are freeways? 

1. Create a map of the highway links showing PM
period level of service based on the volume to capacity ratios in the table
below. How would you characterize traffic in Roanoke? Which is the
worst-performing major facility?

  `V/C` = c("< 0.35",  "0.35 - 0.54", "0.55 - 0.77", "0.78 - 0.93", 
            "0.94 - 0.99", "$\\geq$ 1.00"),

## Lab {-#lab-blocks}

Demographers for the Commonwealth of Virginia --- like those in other
states --- forecast a certain number of residents, households, and jobs for
many years into the future. But this data alone is not sufficient: We believe 
that larger households will make more trips than smaller households.
But we only know how many households and persons there are, and not how many
households of each different size. 

::::{.rmdthink}
For example, let's say that we know there are three households in a zone and nine 
persons. Does that mean that there are three 3-person households? Or two one-person
households and one 7-person household? The number and types of trips generated 
by these two different scenarios could be very different.
::::

A *household classification* model turns these raw counts of households and 
persons into distributions of households by size, number of workers, etc. The
Roanoke classification model works in two steps:

  - The model makes a guess at the distribution by multiplying the average
  persons, vehicles, or workers per household in a zone by a marginal distribution 
  determined from Census tables.
  - The model then adjusts this initial guess (using [IPF](#ipf)) so that the
  joint distribution of households matches what is currently there.
 
The version of the Roanoke model you have installed contains a classification
model, but the marginal and joint distribution tables the model uses contain
nonsense. Your task for this lab is to correct the values in these tables so
that the model will calculate reasonable estimates of the current and future
population.


### Marginal Distributions {-}

The United States Census Bureau attempts to count every person in the United
States every ten years. It also surveys a 1% sample of the population each year
for additional statistical questions (in a program called the American Community
Survey), like income and vehicle ownership. In order to protect respondent's
privacy, Census makes different types of information available at different
geographic levels. For every Census tract in the country, we can get these 
marginal distribution tables:

  - Number of households by household size
  - Number of households by workers per household 
  - Number of households by vehicles available.
  
Using these data, we can calculate how the average distribution of 
households changes based on the average household size in the tract. Figure 
\@ref(fig:hh-marginal) shows precisely this distribution, using a cubic
polynomial to fit the average distribution. Each set of four points represents
one census tract; for instance, the lowest average household size is in tract
`51770001100` with 1.37 persons per household on average. This tract shows
71% of its households having 1 member, 25% having 2, and about 2 percent each
of 3 and 4+ person households.

```{r hh-marginal, fig.cap="Distribution of households by size, based on average households size.", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
counties <- list("Roanoke City" = "770", "Roanoke County" = "161", 
                 "Salem City" = "775")

hh_size <- get_acs(year = 2017,
  geography = "tract", state = "Virginia", county = counties, 
  variables = c(str_c("B08202", sprintf("%03d", c(1, 6, 9, 13, 18)), sep = "_"), 
                "B25008_001")) # also get total population

hh_size_distribution <- hh_size %>% # what data are we working with?
  # The `variable` column is a little hard to work with, so we split it into two
  # columns: "B08202_006" --> "B08202" and "6"
  separate(variable, c("table", "variable"), sep = "_", convert = TRUE) %>%
  # Now we create a new column called size that has the value of the 
  # group if it's a count of households in a category. We also create values
  # to indicate if its a count of the total households in the zone, or if
  # it's the median income.
  mutate(
    size = case_when(
      table == "B25008" ~ "totpop",
      table == "B08202" & variable == 1 ~ "tothh", # value 1 is the total
      variable == 6 ~ "1", 
      variable == 9 ~ "2", 
      variable == 13 ~ "3", 
      variable == 18 ~ "4+", 
      TRUE ~ as.character(NA)
    )
  ) %>%
  # Collapse the income groups summing up all the estimate values by block group.
  # Because there # is only one "total" or "median", the sum is just that value
  group_by(geoid = GEOID, size) %>%
  summarize(estimate = sum(estimate)) %>%
  # Spread all the values, and then regather the income group levels so that
  # `average` and `total` become their own columns
  spread(size, estimate) %>%
  # calculate the average household size
  mutate(average = totpop / tothh) %>%
  gather(size, count, `1`:`4+`) %>%
  # arrange by geoid so that you can see things a little better
  arrange(geoid) %>%
  filter(tothh > 0) %>%
  # calculate the percent of households in each income group
  mutate(percent = count / tothh)

# Declare the data table and which columns make up which plot aesthetics
ggplot(hh_size_distribution, aes(x = average, y = percent, color = size)) +
  geom_point() + # plot the points, scatter plot of x = median income and y = percent
  stat_smooth(formula = y ~ poly(x, 3), method = "lm") + # add average group lines and uncertainty band
  scale_color_discrete("Household size") +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Average Household Size") +
  ylab("Proportion of households of given size")
```


For the most part the distributions make sense, with a few exceptions. It makes
sense that the proportion of 1-person households decreases with average size,
and that the proportion of 4-person households increases. Each of these curves
turns in a weird direction at the end; however, the wide margin on the
distribution means that we're not really confident about where the actual
proportion is. We'll need to do some manual adjusting to these curves.

I have provided you with initial marginal distribution curves for the three
marginal distributions of interest. These files are available 
[on Box](https://byu.box.com/s/gx9s8ylp46qywo9ira9dxv35f31wz5sg), and the
starting values are shown graphically in Figure \@ref(fig:raw-marginals).

```{r raw-marginals, fig.cap="Raw marginal distribution curves from Roanoke region.", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
list(
  "Household Size" = read_csv("data/raw_size.csv"),
  "Workers per Household" = read_csv("data/raw_work.csv"),
  "Vehicles per Household" = read_csv("data/raw_vehicles.csv")
) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "Marginal") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `1`:`0`, names_to = "Size", 
               values_to = "Proportion") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = average, y = Proportion, color = Size)) + 
  geom_line() + facet_wrap(~Marginal, scales = "free_x") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0:1))
```

Rules you need to follow when adjusting the curves:

  1. If the average household size is one, then 100% of households must have
  one person. The same rule applies to zero workers and zero vehicles.
  1. If the average household size is four, there will still be some households
  with only one, two, or three people. This is because the `4` category really
  contains all households with *four or more* members.
  1. The total proportions across all four marginal curves at each $x$ value
  must sum to 1.
  

### Joint Distribution {-}

In the section above we created curves to get the marginal distribution of
household size, vehicles, and workers based on the average in a zone. In order to
make sure that the joint distribution of all of these variables is correct, we
will use IPF with a joint table as the seed. Census does not independently
publish 3-dimensional tables, but the Census Transportation Planning Package
(CTPP) is a partnership between AASHTO and the Census Bureau and it publishes
key tables not available in other places. 

The CTPP data is available 
[through the AASHTO website](http://data5.ctpp.transportation.org/ctpp1216),
or by searching "CTPP". Find table `A112305` for the residence counties where 
your group members are from.  What do you see in this table? What makes sense
and what does not?

I have already gathered the data and done some preliminary preparation for
you to compute the shares that belong in the household seed file. Run the 
code below in an R session (with the `tidyverse` library loaded) to calculate
the necessary shares. Follow along with the code to understand what is happening.

```{r joint_distribution}
raw_counts <- read_csv("https://byu.box.com/shared/static/03t5b6g9cw59aroqxarst55t2khnhmcz.csv") 
  
joint_distribution <- raw_counts %>%
  # the data contain both "estimates" and "margin of error". We only want to
  # keep the estimates rows.
  filter(output == "Estimate")  %>%
  
  # The data records size as text, with `0 workers`. We want to extract the
  # numeric information from these fields. This line of code says, for the variables
  # persons, workers, and vehicles, take all non-numeric characters and replace
  # them with nothing. It looks like gibberish, but it came from lots of Stack
  # Overflow searching. I can't come up with this stuff from thin air, you know.
  mutate_at(
    c("persons", "workers", "vehicles"), 
    function(x) {as.numeric(gsub("([0-9]+).*$", "\\1", x))}
  ) %>%
  
  # the rows that say "total households" get turned to NA by the above process, and we
  # don't want to keep those in anyways.
  filter(!is.na(persons), !is.na(workers), !is.na(vehicles)) %>%
  
  # the roanoke model only includes households with 3+ workers, not 4+. So if a
  # row is for more than 3 workers, we group it as 3
  mutate(workers = ifelse(workers > 3, 3, workers)) %>%
  
  # but this creates a problem where we now have multiple rows with
  # 3 workers. So we need to group and add up.
  group_by(persons, workers, vehicles) %>%
  summarize(count = sum(count)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  
  # Finally, we want to turn the numbers into a share. So we divde the
  # counts by the total count in the whole table.
  mutate(share = count / sum(count))
```

Now we can see the joint distribution of size, workers, and vehicles.
```{r joint_table}
joint_distribution %>%
  group_by(persons) %>%
  select(-count) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = vehicles, values_from = share, names_prefix = "vehicles ") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

This table serves as the seed for the IPF process in the household classification
Save this data table as a DBF file that you can put into the model at
`params/classification/hh_seed.dbf`. The `write.dbf()` function is part of the
`foreign` library.

```{r write}
as.data.frame(joint_distribution) %>% 
  foreign::write.dbf("data/hh_seed.dbf")
```


### Report {-}

For your homework, you should have a complete run of the uncalibrated, "bare" 
RVTPO model. Open the "Trip Generation" submodule by double-clicking on the 
yellow box labeled `Trip Generation`. This submodule has two steps: the 
household classification model and the trip productions model. You can run
just this step of the model (and not the entire travel model) by clicking the
"Run Application" button in the top-left of the Cube window and then selecting the
"Run current group only" option in the dialog.

Open the classified socioeconomic data file that is an input to the trip 
productions step (the file is named `se_classified_2012A.dbf`), and make 
a tabulation report counting up the number of households in each district in the
following three categories:

  - `W3V0` Households with three or more workers and no vehicles.
  - `W0V3` Households with no workers and three or more vehicles. 
  - `P2V2` Households with two people and two vehicles.

The marginal classification curves and the joint distribution seed table are
stored in the `params/classification` folder. Each file is a `.dbf` with the
following format:

  - `hh_size_lookup.dbf`: `[AVG, PERSONS_1, PERSONS_2, PERSONS_3, PERSONS_4]`
  - `hh_workers_lookup.dbf`: `[AVG, WORKERS_0, WORKERS_1, WORKERS_2, WORKERS_3]`
  - `hh_vehicles_lookup.dbf`: `[AVG, VEHICLES_0, VEHICLES_1, VEHICLES_2, VEHICLES_3]`
  - `hh_seed.dbf`: `[WORKERS, PERSONS, VEHICLES, SHARE]` 

Open these files in Cube, and observe that the data contained them is nonsense.
Replace the files in the `params/classification` folder with the distributions
you created above, including the marginal distribution curves you calibrated by
hand and the household seed you constructed from CTPP. Run the trip generation
submodule again, and recreate the tabulation report you previously created. Do
these numbers make more sense?

::::{.rmdexample}
You can edit the DBF files in Cube by hand; its copy-paste feature is not what
you would expect from a software program in 2020 (or 2005). A more efficient
way might be to use the `write.dbf()` function in R.

```{r write-dbf-example, eval = FALSE}
# read the file you edited; there is also a readxl() function for excel
# spreadsheets
read_csv("data/raw_size.csv") %>%
  # need to make sure the names on the columns match what Cube is expecting to
  # get; you'll need to change this for the workers and vehicles
  rename(AVG = average, PERSONS_1 = `1`, PERSONS_2 = `2`,
         `PERSONS_3` = `3`, PERSONS_4 = `4`) %>%
  # read_csv makes a modern data frame called a `tibble`. The old DBF function
  # has no idea what do to with this. So we need to convert the tibble to an
  # old-fashioned `data.frame`
  as.data.frame() %>%
  foreign::write.dbf("data/hh_size_lookup.dbf")
```

::::

The classification model incorporates a zone-level IPF process executed in R; the
script for this process is in `R/classification.R`. Open the script and find 
the place where the maximum IPF iterations are set. Change this parameter to 50,
save the R file, and and re-run both the model and your tabulation report.
Change it again to 100 and note the execution time and any changes in the
tabulation report. How many iterations should you run?


Write a lab report describing the household classification model you have
developed. Describe how you developed your marginal disaggregation curves,
including any assertions you employed in smoothing /adjusting the curves.
Include plots of each curve. Describe how you determined the number of
iterations of IPF to run in your model. Compare the distribution of households
by classification category to the joint distribution you obtained from the CTPP.

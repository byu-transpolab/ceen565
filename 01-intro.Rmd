# Building Blocks {#chap-blocks}

This chapter contains concepts, definitions, and mathematical techniques that will
be used throughout the semester. 

## Planning for Human Systems

If you look out on any sufficiently busy road, you will see a steady stream of
vehicles passing by. Each vehicle is largely indistinguishable from the others,
and it is easy as an engineer responsible for that road to see the cars driving
by as little more than an input to a problem. But the *people* inside the cars
should not be indistinguishable from each other. Each person who is driving or
riding in each of those cars has their own reasons to be driving on that road.
One person might be driving to work; one person might be trying to get home to
his or her family. Another car might hold a family going on vacation, or a group
of friends heading to a movie.

If you don't recognize that each person who travels is 
If the road is congested, then the
only apparent solution is to "fix" the road by expanding its capacity.

## Homework {-#hw-blocks}

> Some of these questions require a completed run of the demonstration model.
For instructions on accessing and running the model, see the [Appendix](#app-demomodel)

1. With the TAZ layer and socioeconomic data in the demonstration model, make a
set of choropleth maps showing: total households; household density; total jobs;
job density; density of manufacturing vs office vs retail employment. Compare
your maps with aerial imagery from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Describe the
spatial patterns of the socioeconomic data in the model region. Identify which
zones constitute the central business district, and identify any outlying
employment centers.

1. With the highway network layer in the demonstration model, create maps
showing: link functional type; link free flow speed; and link hourly capacity.
Compare your maps with aerial imagery from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap.
Identify the major freeways and principal arterials in the model region. *Note*:
you will need to run the demonstration model through the network setup step to
calculate the capacities and append them to the link.
   
1. Find the shortest free-flow speed path along the network between two zones.
Find the shortest distance path between the same two zones. Are the paths the
same? Do the paths match what an online mapping service shows for a trip in the
middle of the night?

1. Open the highway assignment report, which shows vehicle hours and miles
traveled by facility type. What percent of the region's VMT occurs on freeways?
What percent of the region's lane-miles are freeways? 

1. Open the output highway network. Create a map of the 
highway links showing PM period level of service based on the volume to capacity
ratios in the table below. How would you characterize traffic in Roanoke? Which
is the worst-performing major facility?
